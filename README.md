# ScriptEditor
CS121 Script Editor Project

## Summary
Our web application allows users to cut down Shakespeare plays while maintaining the metadata about the script. This way, directors, actors, and producers can work together to cut the script while understanding how their cuts will change the nature of the play by knowing aspects like how many lines a character has or if a character has been removed.
