Act 1
Scene 1

Stage Directions Enter Orlando and Adam.
Speaker ORLANDO
1.1.1 As I remember, Adam, it was upon this
1.1.2 fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand
1.1.3 crowns, and, as thou sayst, charged my brother on
1.1.4 his blessing to breed me well. And there begins my
1.1.5 sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
1.1.6 report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he
1.1.7 keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
1.1.8 properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you
1.1.9 that keeping, for a gentleman of my birth, that
1.1.10 differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are
1.1.11 bred better, for, besides that they are fair with their
1.1.12 feeding, they are taught their manage and, to that
1.1.13 end, riders dearly hired. But I, his brother, gain
1.1.14 nothing under him but growth, for the which his
1.1.15 animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him
1.1.16 as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives
1.1.17 me, the something that nature gave me his countenance
1.1.18 seems to take from me. He lets me feed with
1.1.19 his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and, as
1.1.20 much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my
1.1.21 education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me, and the
1.1.22 spirit of my father, which I think is within me,
1.1.23 begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no
1.1.24 longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy
1.1.25 how to avoid it.
Stage Directions Enter Oliver.
Speaker ADAM
1.1.26 Yonder comes my master, your brother.
Speaker ORLANDO
1.1.27 Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he
1.1.28 will shake me up.
Stage Directions Adam steps aside.
Speaker OLIVER
1.1.29 Now, sir, what make you here?
Speaker ORLANDO
1.1.30 Nothing. I am not taught to make anything.
Speaker OLIVER
1.1.31 What mar you then, sir?
Speaker ORLANDO
1.1.32 Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that
1.1.33 which God made, a poor unworthy brother of
1.1.34 yours, with idleness.
Speaker OLIVER
1.1.35 Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught
1.1.36 awhile.
Speaker ORLANDO
1.1.37 Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with
1.1.38 them? What prodigal portion have I spent that I
1.1.39 should come to such penury?
Speaker OLIVER
1.1.40 Know you where you are, sir?
Speaker ORLANDO
1.1.41 O, sir, very well: here in your orchard.
Speaker OLIVER
1.1.42 Know you before whom, sir?
Speaker ORLANDO
1.1.43 Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I
1.1.44 know you are my eldest brother, and in the gentle
1.1.45 condition of blood you should so know me. The
1.1.46 courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that you
1.1.47 are the first-born, but the same tradition takes not
1.1.48 away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt
1.1.49 us. I have as much of my father in me as you, albeit I
1.1.50 confess your coming before me is nearer to his
1.1.51 reverence.
Speaker OLIVER
Stage Directions , threatening Orlando
1.1.52 What, boy!
Speaker ORLANDO
Stage Directions , holding off Oliver by the throat
1.1.53 Come,
1.1.54 come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
Speaker OLIVER
1.1.55 Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
Speaker ORLANDO
1.1.56 I am no villain. I am the youngest son of Sir
1.1.57 Rowland de Boys. He was my father, and he is
1.1.58 thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains.
1.1.59 Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this
1.1.60 hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out
1.1.61 thy tongue for saying so. Thou hast railed on thyself.
Speaker ADAM
Stage Directions , coming forward
1.1.62 Sweet masters, be patient. For
1.1.63 your father’s remembrance, be at accord.
Speaker OLIVER
Stage Directions , to Orlando
1.1.64 Let me go, I say.
Speaker ORLANDO
1.1.65 I will not till I please. You shall hear me. My
1.1.66 father charged you in his will to give me good
1.1.67 education. You have trained me like a peasant,
1.1.68 obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike
1.1.69 qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
1.1.70 me, and I will no longer endure it. Therefore allow
1.1.71 me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or
1.1.72 give me the poor allottery my father left me by
1.1.73 testament. With that I will go buy my fortunes.
Stage Directions Orlando releases Oliver.
Speaker OLIVER
1.1.74 And what wilt thou do—beg when that is
1.1.75 spent? Well, sir, get you in. I will not long be
1.1.76 troubled with you. You shall have some part of your
1.1.77 will. I pray you leave me.
Speaker ORLANDO
1.1.78 I will no further offend you than becomes
1.1.79 me for my good.
Speaker OLIVER
Stage Directions , to Adam
1.1.80 Get you with him, you old dog.
Speaker ADAM
1.1.81 Is old dog my reward? Most true, I have lost
1.1.82 my teeth in your service. God be with my old
1.1.83 master. He would not have spoke such a word.
Stage Directions Orlando and Adam exit.
Speaker OLIVER
1.1.84 Is it even so? Begin you to grow upon me? I
1.1.85 will physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand
1.1.86 crowns neither.—Holla, Dennis!
Stage Directions Enter Dennis.
Speaker DENNIS
1.1.87 Calls your Worship?
Speaker OLIVER
1.1.88 Was not Charles, the Duke’s wrestler, here to
1.1.89 speak with me?
Speaker DENNIS
1.1.90 So please you, he is here at the door and
1.1.91 importunes access to you.
Speaker OLIVER
1.1.92 Call him in. Dennis exits. ’Twill be a good
1.1.93 way, and tomorrow the wrestling is.
Stage Directions  Dennis exits.
Stage Directions Enter Charles.
Speaker CHARLES
1.1.94 Good morrow to your Worship.
Speaker OLIVER
1.1.95 Good Monsieur Charles, what’s the new news
1.1.96 at the new court?
Speaker CHARLES
1.1.97 There’s no news at the court, sir, but the old
1.1.98 news. That is, the old duke is banished by his
1.1.99 younger brother the new duke, and three or four
1.1.100 loving lords have put themselves into voluntary
1.1.101 exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich
1.1.102 the new duke. Therefore he gives them good leave
1.1.103 to wander.
Speaker OLIVER
1.1.104 Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke’s daughter,
1.1.105 be banished with her father?
Speaker CHARLES
1.1.106 O, no, for the Duke’s daughter her cousin so
1.1.107 loves her, being ever from their cradles bred together,
1.1.108 that she would have followed her exile or have
1.1.109 died to stay behind her. She is at the court and no
1.1.110 less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter,
1.1.111 and never two ladies loved as they do.
Speaker OLIVER
1.1.112 Where will the old duke live?
Speaker CHARLES
1.1.113 They say he is already in the Forest of Arden,
1.1.114 and a many merry men with him; and there they
1.1.115 live like the old Robin Hood of England. They say
1.1.116 many young gentlemen flock to him every day and
1.1.117 fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden
1.1.118 world.
Speaker OLIVER
1.1.119 What, you wrestle tomorrow before the new
1.1.120 duke?
Speaker CHARLES
1.1.121 Marry, do I, sir, and I came to acquaint you
1.1.122 with a matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand
1.1.123 that your younger brother Orlando hath a
1.1.124 disposition to come in disguised against me to try a
1.1.125 fall. Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit, and he
1.1.126 that escapes me without some broken limb shall
1.1.127 acquit him well. Your brother is but young and
1.1.128 tender, and for your love I would be loath to foil
1.1.129 him, as I must for my own honor if he come in.
1.1.130 Therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to
1.1.131 acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him
1.1.132 from his intendment, or brook such disgrace well
1.1.133 as he shall run into, in that it is a thing of his own
1.1.134 search, and altogether against my will.
Speaker OLIVER
1.1.135 Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which
1.1.136 thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
1.1.137 myself notice of my brother’s purpose herein, and
1.1.138 have by underhand means labored to dissuade him
1.1.139 from it; but he is resolute. I’ll tell thee, Charles, it is
1.1.140 the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of
1.1.141 ambition, an envious emulator of every man’s good
1.1.142 parts, a secret and villainous contriver against me
1.1.143 his natural brother. Therefore use thy discretion. I
1.1.144 had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger.
1.1.145 And thou wert best look to ’t, for if thou dost him
1.1.146 any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace
1.1.147 himself on thee, he will practice against thee by
1.1.148 poison, entrap thee by some treacherous device,
1.1.149 and never leave thee till he hath ta’en thy life by
1.1.150 some indirect means or other. For I assure thee—
1.1.151 and almost with tears I speak it—there is not one so
1.1.152 young and so villainous this day living. I speak but
1.1.153 brotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to
1.1.154 thee as he is, I must blush and weep, and thou must
1.1.155 look pale and wonder.
Speaker CHARLES
1.1.156 I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he
1.1.157 come tomorrow, I’ll give him his payment. If ever
1.1.158 he go alone again, I’ll never wrestle for prize more.
1.1.159 And so God keep your Worship.
Speaker OLIVER
1.1.160 Farewell, good Charles.Charles exits.
1.1.161 Now will I stir this gamester. I hope I shall see an
1.1.162 end of him, for my soul—yet I know not why—
1.1.163 hates nothing more than he. Yet he’s gentle, never
1.1.164 schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of all
1.1.165 sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much in
1.1.166 the heart of the world, and especially of my own
1.1.167 people, who best know him, that I am altogether
1.1.168 misprized. But it shall not be so long; this wrestler
1.1.169 shall clear all. Nothing remains but that I kindle the
1.1.170 boy thither, which now I’ll go about.
Stage Directions Charles exits.
Stage Directions He exits.Scene 1

Stage Directions Enter Rosalind and Celia.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.1 I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.2 Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am
1.2.3 mistress of, and would you yet I were merrier?
1.2.4 Unless you could teach me to forget a banished
1.2.5 father, you must not learn me how to remember
1.2.6 any extraordinary pleasure.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.7 Herein I see thou lov’st me not with the full
1.2.8 weight that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished
1.2.9 father, had banished thy uncle, the Duke my father,
1.2.10 so thou hadst been still with me, I could have taught
1.2.11 my love to take thy father for mine. So wouldst thou,
1.2.12 if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
1.2.13 tempered as mine is to thee.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.14 Well, I will forget the condition of my estate
1.2.15 to rejoice in yours.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.16 You know my father hath no child but I, nor
1.2.17 none is like to have; and truly, when he dies, thou
1.2.18 shalt be his heir, for what he hath taken away from
1.2.19 thy father perforce, I will render thee again in
1.2.20 affection. By mine honor I will, and when I break
1.2.21 that oath, let me turn monster. Therefore, my sweet
1.2.22 Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.23 From henceforth I will, coz, and devise
1.2.24 sports. Let me see—what think you of falling in
1.2.25 love?
Speaker CELIA
1.2.26 Marry, I prithee do, to make sport withal; but
1.2.27 love no man in good earnest, nor no further in
1.2.28 sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou
1.2.29 mayst in honor come off again.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.30 What shall be our sport, then?
Speaker CELIA
1.2.31 Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune
1.2.32 from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be
1.2.33 bestowed equally.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.34 I would we could do so, for her benefits are
1.2.35 mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman
1.2.36 doth most mistake in her gifts to women.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.37 ’Tis true, for those that she makes fair she scarce
1.2.38 makes honest, and those that she makes honest she
1.2.39 makes very ill-favoredly.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.40 Nay, now thou goest from Fortune’s office to
1.2.41 Nature’s. Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in
1.2.42 the lineaments of nature.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.43 No? When Nature hath made a fair creature,
1.2.44 may she not by fortune fall into the fire?Enter Touchstone.
1.2.45 Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune,
1.2.46 hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the
1.2.47 argument?
Stage Directions Enter Touchstone.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.48 Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature,
1.2.49 when Fortune makes Nature’s natural the
1.2.50 cutter-off of Nature’s wit.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.51 Peradventure this is not Fortune’s work neither,
1.2.52 but Nature’s, who perceiveth our natural wits too
1.2.53 dull to reason of such goddesses, and hath sent
1.2.54 this natural for our whetstone, for always the dullness
1.2.55 of the fool is the whetstone of the wits. ToTouchstone. 
1.2.56 How now, wit, whither wander you?
Stage Directions  ToTouchstone. 
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
1.2.57 Mistress, you must come away to your
1.2.58 father.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.59 Were you made the messenger?
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
1.2.60 No, by mine honor, but I was bid to come
1.2.61 for you.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.62 Where learned you that oath, fool?
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
1.2.63 Of a certain knight that swore by his
1.2.64 honor they were good pancakes, and swore by his
1.2.65 honor the mustard was naught. Now, I’ll stand to it,
1.2.66 the pancakes were naught and the mustard was
1.2.67 good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.68 How prove you that in the great heap of your
1.2.69 knowledge?
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.70 Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
1.2.71 Stand you both forth now: stroke your
1.2.72 chins, and swear by your beards that I am a knave.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.73 By our beards (if we had them), thou art.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
1.2.74 By my knavery (if I had it), then I were.
1.2.75 But if you swear by that that is not, you are not
1.2.76 forsworn. No more was this knight swearing by his
1.2.77 honor, for he never had any, or if he had, he had
1.2.78 sworn it away before ever he saw those pancakes or
1.2.79 that mustard.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.80 Prithee, who is ’t that thou mean’st?
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
1.2.81 One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.82 My father’s love is enough to honor him.
1.2.83 Enough. Speak no more of him; you’ll be whipped
1.2.84 for taxation one of these days.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
1.2.85 The more pity that fools may not speak
1.2.86 wisely what wise men do foolishly.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.87 By my troth, thou sayest true. For, since the little
1.2.88 wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery
1.2.89 that wise men have makes a great show. Here
1.2.90 comes Monsieur Le Beau.
Stage Directions Enter Le Beau.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.91 With his mouth full of news.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.92 Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their
1.2.93 young.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.94 Then shall we be news-crammed.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.95 All the better. We shall be the more
1.2.96 marketable.—Bonjour, Monsieur Le Beau. What’s
1.2.97 the news?
Speaker LE BEAU
1.2.98 Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.99 Sport? Of what color?
Speaker LE BEAU
1.2.100 What color, madam? How shall I answer you?
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.101 As wit and fortune will.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
1.2.102 Or as the destinies decrees.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.103 Well said. That was laid on with a trowel.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
1.2.104 Nay, if I keep not my rank—
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.105 Thou losest thy old smell.
Speaker LE BEAU
1.2.106 You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of
1.2.107 good wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.108 Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.
Speaker LE BEAU
1.2.109 I will tell you the beginning, and if it please
1.2.110 your Ladyships, you may see the end, for the best is
1.2.111 yet to do, and here, where you are, they are coming
1.2.112 to perform it.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.113 Well, the beginning that is dead and buried.
Speaker LE BEAU
1.2.114 There comes an old man and his three sons—
Speaker CELIA
1.2.115 I could match this beginning with an old tale.
Speaker LE BEAU
1.2.116 Three proper young men of excellent growth
1.2.117 and presence.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.118 With bills on their necks: Be it known untoall men by these presents.
Speaker LE BEAU
1.2.120 The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles,
1.2.121 the Duke’s wrestler, which Charles in a moment
1.2.122 threw him and broke three of his ribs, that there is
1.2.123 little hope of life in him. So he served the second,
1.2.124 and so the third. Yonder they lie, the poor old man
1.2.125 their father making such pitiful dole over them that
1.2.126 all the beholders take his part with weeping.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.127 Alas!
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
1.2.128 But what is the sport, monsieur, that the
1.2.129 ladies have lost?
Speaker LE BEAU
1.2.130 Why, this that I speak of.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
1.2.131 Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is
1.2.132 the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was
1.2.133 sport for ladies.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.134 Or I, I promise thee.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.135 But is there any else longs to see this broken
1.2.136 music in his sides? Is there yet another dotes upon
1.2.137 rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?
Speaker LE BEAU
1.2.138 You must if you stay here, for here is the place
1.2.139 appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to
1.2.140 perform it.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.141 Yonder sure they are coming. Let us now stay
1.2.142 and see it.
Stage Directions Flourish. Enter Duke Frederick, Lords, Orlando,Charles, and Attendants.
Speaker DUKE FREDERICK
1.2.143 Come on. Since the youth will not be
1.2.144 entreated, his own peril on his forwardness.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , to Le Beau
1.2.145 Is yonder the man?
Speaker LE BEAU
1.2.146 Even he, madam.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.147 Alas, he is too young. Yet he looks successfully.
Speaker DUKE FREDERICK
1.2.148 How now, daughter and cousin? Are
1.2.149 you crept hither to see the wrestling?
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.150 Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.
Speaker DUKE FREDERICK
1.2.151 You will take little delight in it, I can
1.2.152 tell you, there is such odds in the man. In pity of the
1.2.153 challenger’s youth, I would fain dissuade him, but
1.2.154 he will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if
1.2.155 you can move him.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.156 Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.
Speaker DUKE FREDERICK
1.2.157 Do so. I’ll not be by.
Stage Directions He steps aside.
Speaker LE BEAU
Stage Directions , to Orlando
1.2.158 Monsieur the challenger, the
1.2.159 Princess calls for you.
Speaker ORLANDO
1.2.160 I attend them with all respect and duty.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.161 Young man, have you challenged Charles the
1.2.162 wrestler?
Speaker ORLANDO
1.2.163 No, fair princess. He is the general challenger.
1.2.164 I come but in as others do, to try with him the
1.2.165 strength of my youth.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.166 Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for
1.2.167 your years. You have seen cruel proof of this man’s
1.2.168 strength. If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew
1.2.169 yourself with your judgment, the fear of your adventure
1.2.170 would counsel you to a more equal enterprise.
1.2.171 We pray you for your own sake to embrace your
1.2.172 own safety and give over this attempt.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.173 Do, young sir. Your reputation shall not
1.2.174 therefore be misprized. We will make it our suit to
1.2.175 the Duke that the wrestling might not go forward.
Speaker ORLANDO
1.2.176 I beseech you, punish me not with your hard
1.2.177 thoughts, wherein I confess me much guilty to deny
1.2.178 so fair and excellent ladies anything. But let your
1.2.179 fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial,
1.2.180 wherein, if I be foiled, there is but one shamed that
1.2.181 was never gracious; if killed, but one dead that is
1.2.182 willing to be so. I shall do my friends no wrong, for
1.2.183 I have none to lament me; the world no injury, for
1.2.184 in it I have nothing. Only in the world I fill up a
1.2.185 place which may be better supplied when I have
1.2.186 made it empty.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.187 The little strength that I have, I would it
1.2.188 were with you.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.189 And mine, to eke out hers.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.190 Fare you well. Pray heaven I be deceived in
1.2.191 you.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.192 Your heart’s desires be with you.
Speaker CHARLES
1.2.193 Come, where is this young gallant that is so
1.2.194 desirous to lie with his mother Earthearth?
Speaker ORLANDO
1.2.195 Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more
1.2.196 modest working.
Speaker DUKE FREDERICK
Stage Directions , coming forward
1.2.197 You shall try but
1.2.198 one fall.
Speaker CHARLES
1.2.199 No, I warrant your Grace you shall not entreat
1.2.200 him to a second, that have so mightily persuaded
1.2.201 him from a first.
Speaker ORLANDO
1.2.202 You mean to mock me after, you should not
1.2.203 have mocked me before. But come your ways.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.204 Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!
Speaker CELIA
1.2.205 I would I were invisible, to catch the strong
1.2.206 fellow by the leg.
Stage Directions Orlando and Charles wrestle.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.207 O excellent young man!
Speaker CELIA
1.2.208 If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who
1.2.209 should down.

1.2.211 Yes, I beseech your Grace. I am not yet well

Speaker DUKE FREDERICK
1.2.213 How dost thou, Charles?
Speaker LE BEAU

Stage Directions Charles is carried off by Attendants.
Speaker ORLANDO
1.2.217 Orlando, my liege, the youngest son of Sir
1.2.218 Rowland de Boys.
Speaker DUKE FREDERICK
1.2.219 I would thou hadst been son to some man else.
1.2.220 The world esteemed thy father honorable,
1.2.221 But I did find him still mine enemy.
1.2.222 Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this
1.2.223 deed
1.2.224 Hadst thou descended from another house.
1.2.225 But fare thee well. Thou art a gallant youth.
1.2.226 I would thou hadst told me of another father.
Stage Directions Duke exits with Touchstone, Le Beau,Lords, and Attendants.
Speaker CELIA
Stage Directions , to Rosalind
1.2.227 Were I my father, coz, would I do this?
Speaker ORLANDO
1.2.228 I am more proud to be Sir Rowland’s son,
1.2.229 His youngest son, and would not change that calling
1.2.230 To be adopted heir to Frederick.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , to Celia
1.2.231 My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,
1.2.232 And all the world was of my father’s mind.
1.2.233 Had I before known this young man his son,
1.2.234 I should have given him tears unto entreaties
1.2.235 Ere he should thus have ventured.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.236 Gentle cousin,
1.2.237 Let us go thank him and encourage him.
1.2.238 My father’s rough and envious disposition
1.2.239 Sticks me at heart.—Sir, you have well deserved.
1.2.240 If you do keep your promises in love
1.2.241 But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,
1.2.242 Your mistress shall be happy.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , giving Orlando a chain from her neck
1.2.243 Gentleman,
1.2.244 Wear this for me—one out of suits with Fortunefortune,
1.2.245 That could give more but that her hand lacks
1.2.246 means.—
1.2.247 Shall we go, coz?
Speaker CELIA
1.2.248 Ay.—Fare you well, fair gentleman.
Speaker ORLANDO
Stage Directions , aside
1.2.249 Can I not say I thank you? My better parts
1.2.250 Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up
1.2.251 Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , to Celia
1.2.252 He calls us back. My pride fell with my fortunes.
1.2.253 I’ll ask him what he would.—Did you call, sir?
1.2.254 Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown
1.2.255 More than your enemies.
Speaker CELIA
1.2.256 Will you go, coz?
Speaker ROSALIND
1.2.257 Have with you. To Orlando. Fare you well.
Stage Directions  To Orlando.
Stage Directions Rosalind and Celia exit.
Speaker ORLANDO
1.2.258 What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
1.2.259 I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.
1.2.260 O poor Orlando! Thou art overthrown.
1.2.261 Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
Stage Directions Enter Le Beau.
Speaker LE BEAU
1.2.262 Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
1.2.263 To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved
1.2.264 High commendation, true applause, and love,
1.2.265 Yet such is now the Duke’s condition
1.2.266 That he misconsters all that you have done.
1.2.267 The Duke is humorous. What he is indeed
1.2.268 More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.
Speaker ORLANDO
1.2.269 I thank you, sir, and pray you tell me this:
1.2.270 Which of the two was daughter of the duke
1.2.271 That here was at the wrestling?
Speaker LE BEAU
1.2.272 Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners,
1.2.273 But yet indeed the smaller is his daughter.
1.2.274 The other is daughter to the banished duke,
1.2.275 And here detained by her usurping uncle
1.2.276 To keep his daughter company, whose loves
1.2.277 Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
1.2.278 But I can tell you that of late this duke
1.2.279 Hath ta’en displeasure ’gainst his gentle niece,
1.2.280 Grounded upon no other argument
1.2.281 But that the people praise her for her virtues
1.2.282 And pity her for her good father’s sake;
1.2.283 And, on my life, his malice ’gainst the lady
1.2.284 Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well.
1.2.285 Hereafter, in a better world than this,
1.2.286 I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.
Speaker ORLANDO
1.2.287 I rest much bounden to you. Fare you well.Le Beau exits.
1.2.288 Thus must I from the smoke into the smother,
1.2.289 From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother.
1.2.290 But heavenly Rosalind!

Stage Directions Enter Celia and Rosalind.
Speaker CELIA
1.3.1 Why, cousin! Why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy,
1.3.2 not a word?
Speaker ROSALIND
1.3.3 Not one to throw at a dog.
Speaker CELIA
1.3.4 No, thy words are too precious to be cast away
1.3.5 upon curs. Throw some of them at me. Come, lame
1.3.6 me with reasons.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.3.7 Then there were two cousins laid up, when
1.3.8 the one should be lamed with reasons, and the
1.3.9 other mad without any.
Speaker CELIA
1.3.10 But is all this for your father?
Speaker ROSALIND
1.3.11 No, some of it is for my child’s father. O,
1.3.12 how full of briers is this working-day world!
Speaker CELIA
1.3.13 They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in
1.3.14 holiday foolery. If we walk not in the trodden paths,
1.3.15 our very petticoats will catch them.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.3.16 I could shake them off my coat. These burs
1.3.17 are in my heart.
Speaker CELIA
1.3.18 Hem them away.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.3.19 I would try, if I could cry hem and have
1.3.20 him.
Speaker CELIA
1.3.21 Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.3.22 O, they take the part of a better wrestler
1.3.23 than myself.
Speaker CELIA
1.3.24 O, a good wish upon you. You will try in time, in
1.3.25 despite of a fall. But turning these jests out of
1.3.26 service, let us talk in good earnest. Is it possible on
1.3.27 such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking
1.3.28 with old Sir Rowland’s youngest son?
Speaker ROSALIND
1.3.29 The Duke my father loved his father dearly.
Speaker CELIA
1.3.30 Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his
1.3.31 son dearly? By this kind of chase I should hate him,
1.3.32 for my father hated his father dearly. Yet I hate not
1.3.33 Orlando.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.3.34 No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
Speaker CELIA
1.3.35 Why should I not? Doth he not deserve well?
Speaker ROSALIND
1.3.36 Let me love him for that, and do you love
1.3.37 him because I do.Enter Duke Frederick with Lords.
1.3.38 Look, here comes the Duke.
Stage Directions Enter Duke Frederick with Lords.
Speaker CELIA
1.3.39 With his eyes full of anger.
Speaker DUKE FREDERICK
Stage Directions , to Rosalind
1.3.40 Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste,
1.3.41 And get you from our court.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.3.42 Me, uncle?
Speaker DUKE FREDERICK
1.3.43 You, cousin.
1.3.44 Within these ten days if that thou beest found
1.3.45 So near our public court as twenty miles,
1.3.46 Thou diest for it.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.3.47 I do beseech your Grace,
1.3.48 Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me.
1.3.49 If with myself I hold intelligence
1.3.50 Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,
1.3.51 If that I do not dream or be not frantic—
1.3.52 As I do trust I am not—then, dear uncle,
1.3.53 Never so much as in a thought unborn
1.3.54 Did I offend your Highness.
Speaker DUKE FREDERICK
1.3.55 Thus do all traitors.
1.3.56 If their purgation did consist in words,
1.3.57 They are as innocent as grace itself.
1.3.58 Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.3.59 Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor.
1.3.60 Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
Speaker DUKE FREDERICK
1.3.61 Thou art thy father’s daughter. There’s enough.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.3.62 So was I when your Highness took his dukedom.
1.3.63 So was I when your Highness banished him.
1.3.64 Treason is not inherited, my lord,
1.3.65 Or if we did derive it from our friends,
1.3.66 What’s that to me? My father was no traitor.
1.3.67 Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
1.3.68 To think my poverty is treacherous.
Speaker CELIA
1.3.69 Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
Speaker DUKE FREDERICK
1.3.70 Ay, Celia, we stayed her for your sake;
1.3.71 Else had she with her father ranged along.
Speaker CELIA
1.3.72 I did not then entreat to have her stay.
1.3.73 It was your pleasure and your own remorse.
1.3.74 I was too young that time to value her,
1.3.75 But now I know her. If she be a traitor,
1.3.76 Why, so am I. We still have slept together,
1.3.77 Rose at an instant, learned, played, eat together,
1.3.78 And, wheresoe’er we went, like Juno’s swans
1.3.79 Still we went coupled and inseparable.
Speaker DUKE FREDERICK
1.3.80 She is too subtle for thee, and her smoothness,
1.3.81 Her very silence, and her patience
1.3.82 Speak to the people, and they pity her.
1.3.83 Thou art a fool. She robs thee of thy name,
1.3.84 And thou wilt show more bright and seem more
1.3.85 virtuous
1.3.86 When she is gone. Then open not thy lips.
1.3.87 Firm and irrevocable is my doom
1.3.88 Which I have passed upon her. She is banished.
Speaker CELIA
1.3.89 Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege.
1.3.90 I cannot live out of her company.
Speaker DUKE FREDERICK
1.3.91 You are a fool.—You, niece, provide yourself.
1.3.92 If you outstay the time, upon mine honor
1.3.93 And in the greatness of my word, you die.
Stage Directions Duke and Lords exit.
Speaker CELIA
1.3.94 O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?
1.3.95 Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
1.3.96 I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.3.97 I have more cause.
Speaker CELIA
1.3.98 Thou hast not, cousin.
1.3.99 Prithee, be cheerful. Know’st thou not the Duke
1.3.100 Hath banished me, his daughter?
Speaker ROSALIND
1.3.101 That he hath not.
Speaker CELIA
1.3.102 No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love
1.3.103 Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one.
1.3.104 Shall we be sundered? Shall we part, sweet girl?
1.3.105 No, let my father seek another heir.
1.3.106 Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
1.3.107 Whither to go, and what to bear with us,
1.3.108 And do not seek to take your change upon you,
1.3.109 To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out.
1.3.110 For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
1.3.111 Say what thou canst, I’ll go along with thee.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.3.112 Why, whither shall we go?
Speaker CELIA
1.3.113 To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.3.114 Alas, what danger will it be to us,
1.3.115 Maids as we are, to travel forth so far?
1.3.116 Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
Speaker CELIA
1.3.117 I’ll put myself in poor and mean attire,
1.3.118 And with a kind of umber smirch my face.
1.3.119 The like do you. So shall we pass along
1.3.120 And never stir assailants.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.3.121 Were it not better,
1.3.122 Because that I am more than common tall,
1.3.123 That I did suit me all points like a man?
1.3.124 A gallant curtal-ax upon my thigh,
1.3.125 A boar-spear in my hand, and in my heart
1.3.126 Lie there what hidden woman’s fear there will,
1.3.127 We’ll have a swashing and a martial outside—
1.3.128 As many other mannish cowards have
1.3.129 That do outface it with their semblances.
Speaker CELIA
1.3.130 What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
Speaker ROSALIND
1.3.131 I’ll have no worse a name than Jove’s own page,
1.3.132 And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
1.3.133 But what will you be called?
Speaker CELIA
1.3.134 Something that hath a reference to my state:
1.3.135 No longer Celia, but Aliena.
Speaker ROSALIND
1.3.136 But, cousin, what if we assayed to steal
1.3.137 The clownish fool out of your father’s court?
1.3.138 Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
Speaker CELIA
1.3.139 He’ll go along o’er the wide world with me.
1.3.140 Leave me alone to woo him. Let’s away
1.3.141 And get our jewels and our wealth together,
1.3.142 Devise the fittest time and safest way
1.3.143 To hide us from pursuit that will be made
1.3.144 After my flight. Now go we in content
1.3.145 To liberty, and not to banishment.

Scene 2

Stage Directions Enter Duke Senior, Amiens, and two or three Lords, likeforesters.
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
2.1.1 Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
2.1.2 Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
2.1.3 Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
2.1.4 More free from peril than the envious court?
2.1.5 Here feel we not the penalty of Adam,
2.1.6 The seasons’ difference, as the icy fang
2.1.7 And churlish chiding of the winter’s wind,
2.1.8 Which when it bites and blows upon my body
2.1.9 Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
2.1.10 This is no flattery. These are counselorsThat feelingly persuade me what I am.
2.1.12 Sweet are the uses of adversity,
2.1.13 Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
2.1.14 Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.
2.1.15 And this our life, exempt from public haunt,
2.1.16 Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
2.1.17 Sermons in stones, and good in everything.
Speaker AMIENS
2.1.18 I would not change it. Happy is your Grace,
2.1.19 That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
2.1.20 Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
2.1.21 Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
2.1.22 And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
2.1.23 Being native burghers of this desert city,
2.1.24 Should in their own confines with forkèd heads
2.1.25 Have their round haunches gored.
Speaker FIRST LORD
2.1.26 Indeed, my lord,
2.1.27 The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,
2.1.28 And in that kind swears you do more usurp
2.1.29 Than doth your brother that hath banished you.
2.1.30 Today my Lord of Amiens and myself
2.1.31 Did steal behind him as he lay along
2.1.32 Under an oak, whose antique root peeps out
2.1.33 Upon the brook that brawls along this wood;
2.1.34 To the which place a poor sequestered stag
2.1.35 That from the hunter’s aim had ta’en a hurt
2.1.36 Did come to languish. And indeed, my lord,
2.1.37 The wretched animal heaved forth such groans
2.1.38 That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
2.1.39 Almost to bursting, and the big round tears
2.1.40 Coursed one another down his innocent nose
2.1.41 In piteous chase. And thus the hairy fool,
2.1.42 Much markèd of the melancholy Jaques,
2.1.43 Stood on th’ extremest verge of the swift brook,
2.1.44 Augmenting it with tears.
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
2.1.45 But what said Jaques?
2.1.46 Did he not moralize this spectacle?
Speaker FIRST LORD
2.1.47 O yes, into a thousand similes.
2.1.48 First, for his weeping into the needless stream:
2.1.49 Poor deer, quoth he, thou mak’st a testamentAs worldlings do, giving thy sum of moreTo that which had too much. Then, being there
2.1.52 alone,
2.1.53 Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:
2.1.54 ’Tis right, quoth he. Thus misery doth partACT 2. SC. 2The flux of company. Anon a careless herd,
2.1.56 Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
2.1.57 And never stays to greet him. Ay, quoth Jaques,
2.1.58 Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens.’Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you lookUpon that poor and broken bankrupt there?
2.1.61 Thus most invectively he pierceth through
2.1.62 The body of country, city, court,
2.1.63 Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we
2.1.64 Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what’s worse,
2.1.65 To fright the animals and to kill them up
2.1.66 In their assigned and native dwelling place.
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
2.1.67 And did you leave him in this contemplation?
Speaker SECOND LORD
2.1.68 We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
2.1.69 Upon the sobbing deer.
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
2.1.70 Show me the place.
2.1.71 I love to cope him in these sullen fits,
2.1.72 For then he’s full of matter.
Speaker FIRST LORD
2.1.73 I’ll bring you to him straight.
Stage Directions They exit.Scene 2

Stage Directions Enter Duke Frederick with Lords.
Speaker DUKE FREDERICK
2.2.1 Can it be possible that no man saw them?
2.2.2 It cannot be. Some villains of my court
2.2.3 Are of consent and sufferance in this.
Speaker FIRST LORD
2.2.4 I cannot hear of any that did see her.
2.2.5 The ladies her attendants of her chamber
2.2.6 Saw her abed, and in the morning early
2.2.7 They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.
Speaker SECOND LORD
2.2.8 My lord, the roinish clown at whom so oft
2.2.9 Your Grace was wont to laugh is also missing.
2.2.10 Hisperia, the Princess’ gentlewoman,
2.2.11 Confesses that she secretly o’erheard
2.2.12 Your daughter and her cousin much commend
2.2.13 The parts and graces of the wrestler
2.2.14 That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles,
2.2.15 And she believes wherever they are gone
2.2.16 That youth is surely in their company.
Speaker DUKE FREDERICK
2.2.17 Send to his brother. Fetch that gallant hither.
2.2.18 If he be absent, bring his brother to me.
2.2.19 I’ll make him find him. Do this suddenly,
2.2.20 And let not search and inquisition quail
2.2.21 To bring again these foolish runaways.

Stage Directions Enter Orlando and Adam, meeting.
Speaker ORLANDO
2.3.1 Who’s there?
Speaker ADAM
2.3.2 What, my young master, O my gentle master,
2.3.3 O my sweet master, O you memory
2.3.4 Of old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here?
2.3.5 Why are you virtuous? Why do people love you?
2.3.6 And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?
2.3.7 Why would you be so fond to overcome
2.3.8 The bonny prizer of the humorous duke?
2.3.9 Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
2.3.10 Know you not, master, to some kind of men
2.3.11 Their graces serve them but as enemies?
2.3.12 No more do yours. Your virtues, gentle master,
2.3.13 Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
2.3.14 O, what a world is this when what is comely
2.3.15 Envenoms him that bears it!
Speaker ORLANDO
2.3.16 Why, what’s the matter?
Speaker ADAM
2.3.17 O unhappy youth,
2.3.18 Come not within these doors. Within this roof
2.3.19 The enemy of all your graces lives.
2.3.20 Your brother—no, no brother—yet the son—
2.3.21 Yet not the son, I will not call him son—
2.3.22 Of him I was about to call his father,
2.3.23 Hath heard your praises, and this night he means
2.3.24 To burn the lodging where you use to lie,
2.3.25 And you within it. If he fail of that,
2.3.26 He will have other means to cut you off.
2.3.27 I overheard him and his practices.
2.3.28 This is no place, this house is but a butchery.
2.3.29 Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
Speaker ORLANDO
2.3.30 Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
Speaker ADAM
2.3.31 No matter whither, so you come not here.
Speaker ORLANDO
2.3.32 What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food,
2.3.33 Or with a base and boist’rous sword enforce
2.3.34 A thievish living on the common road?
2.3.35 This I must do, or know not what to do;
2.3.36 Yet this I will not do, do how I can.
2.3.37 I rather will subject me to the malice
2.3.38 Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
Speaker ADAM
2.3.39 But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
2.3.40 The thrifty hire I saved under your father,
2.3.41 Which I did store to be my foster nurse
2.3.42 When service should in my old limbs lie lame,
2.3.43 And unregarded age in corners thrown.
2.3.44 Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
2.3.45 Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
2.3.46 Be comfort to my age. Here is the gold.
2.3.47 All this I give you. Let me be your servant.
2.3.48 Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty,
2.3.49 For in my youth I never did apply
2.3.50 Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
2.3.51 Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
2.3.52 The means of weakness and debility.
2.3.53 Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
2.3.54 Frosty but kindly. Let me go with you.
2.3.55 I’ll do the service of a younger man
2.3.56 In all your business and necessities.
Speaker ORLANDO
2.3.57 O good old man, how well in thee appears
2.3.58 The constant service of the antique world,
2.3.59 When service sweat for duty, not for meed.
2.3.60 Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
2.3.61 Where none will sweat but for promotion,
2.3.62 And having that do choke their service up
2.3.63 Even with the having. It is not so with thee.
2.3.64 But, poor old man, thou prun’st a rotten tree
2.3.65 That cannot so much as a blossom yield
2.3.66 In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.
2.3.67 But come thy ways. We’ll go along together,
2.3.68 And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,
2.3.69 We’ll light upon some settled low content.
Speaker ADAM
2.3.70 Master, go on, and I will follow thee
2.3.71 To the last gasp with truth and loyalty.
2.3.72 From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
2.3.73 Here livèd I, but now live here no more.
2.3.74 At seventeen years, many their fortunes seek,
2.3.75 But at fourscore, it is too late a week.
2.3.76 Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
2.3.77 Than to die well, and not my master’s debtor.

2.4.2 I care not for my spirits, if my legs were
2.4.3 not weary.
Speaker ROSALIND
2.4.4 I could find in my heart to disgrace my
2.4.5 man’s apparel and to cry like a woman, but I must
2.4.6 comfort the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose
2.4.7 ought to show itself courageous to petticoat. Therefore
2.4.8 courage, good Aliena.
Speaker CELIA
2.4.9 I pray you bear with me. I cannot go no further.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
2.4.10 For my part, I had rather bear with you
2.4.11 than bear you. Yet I should bear no cross if I did
2.4.12 bear you, for I think you have no money in your
2.4.13 purse.
Speaker ROSALIND
2.4.14 Well, this is the Forest of Arden.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
2.4.15 Ay, now am I in Arden, the more fool I.
2.4.16 When I was at home I was in a better place, but
2.4.17 travelers must be content.
Speaker ROSALIND
2.4.18 Ay, be so, good Touchstone.Enter Corin and Silvius.
2.4.19 Look you who comes here, a young man and an old
2.4.20 in solemn talk.
Stage Directions Enter Corin and Silvius.
Stage Directions Rosalind, Celia, and Touchstone step aside andeavesdrop.
Speaker CORIN
Stage Directions , to Silvius
2.4.21 That is the way to make her scorn you still.
Speaker SILVIUS
2.4.22 O Corin, that thou knew’st how I do love her!
Speaker CORIN
2.4.23 I partly guess, for I have loved ere now.
Speaker SILVIUS
2.4.24 No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,
2.4.25 Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
2.4.26 As ever sighed upon a midnight pillow.
2.4.27 But if thy love were ever like to mine—
2.4.28 As sure I think did never man love so—
2.4.29 How many actions most ridiculous
2.4.30 Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
Speaker CORIN
2.4.31 Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
Speaker SILVIUS
2.4.32 O, thou didst then never love so heartily.
2.4.33 If thou rememb’rest not the slightest folly
2.4.34 That ever love did make thee run into,
2.4.35 Thou hast not loved.
2.4.36 Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,
2.4.37 Wearing thy hearer in thy mistress’ praise,
2.4.38 Thou hast not loved.
2.4.39 Or if thou hast not broke from company
2.4.40 Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,
2.4.41 Thou hast not loved.
2.4.42 O Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe!
Stage Directions He exits.
Speaker ROSALIND
2.4.43 Alas, poor shepherd, searching of thy wound,
2.4.44 I have by hard adventure found mine own.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
2.4.45 And I mine. I remember when I was in
2.4.46 love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him
2.4.47 take that for coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I
2.4.48 remember the kissing of her batler, and the cow’s
2.4.49 dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked;
2.4.50 and I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of
2.4.51 her, from whom I took two cods and, giving her
2.4.52 them again, said with weeping tears Wear these formy sake. We that are true lovers run into strange
2.4.54 capers. But as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature
2.4.55 in love mortal in folly.
Speaker ROSALIND
2.4.56 Thou speak’st wiser than thou art ware of.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
2.4.57 Nay, I shall ne’er be ware of mine own
2.4.58 wit till I break my shins against it.
Speaker ROSALIND
2.4.59 Jove, Jove, this shepherd’s passion
2.4.60 Is much upon my fashion.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
2.4.61 And mine, but it grows something stale
2.4.62 with me.
Speaker CELIA
2.4.63 I pray you, one of you question yond man, if he
2.4.64 for gold will give us any food. I faint almost to death.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
Stage Directions , to Corin
2.4.65 Holla, you clown!
Speaker ROSALIND
2.4.66 Peace, fool. He’s not thy kinsman.
Speaker CORIN
2.4.67 Who calls?
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
2.4.68 Your betters, sir.
Speaker CORIN
2.4.69 Else are they very wretched.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , to Touchstone
2.4.70 Peace, I say. As Ganymede, to Corin. Good even to
2.4.71 you, friend.
Stage Directions  As Ganymede, to Corin.
Stage Directions As Ganymede

Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
2.4.73 I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold
2.4.74 Can in this desert place buy entertainment,
2.4.75 Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed.
2.4.76 Here’s a young maid with travel much oppressed,.
2.4.77 And faints for succor.
Speaker CORIN
2.4.78 Fair sir, I pity her
2.4.79 And wish for her sake more than for mine own
2.4.80 My fortunes were more able to relieve her.
2.4.81 But I am shepherd to another man
2.4.82 And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.
2.4.83 My master is of churlish disposition
2.4.84 And little recks to find the way to heaven
2.4.85 By doing deeds of hospitality.
2.4.86 Besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed
2.4.87 Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,
2.4.88 By reason of his absence, there is nothing
2.4.89 That you will feed on. But what is, come see,
2.4.90 And in my voice most welcome shall you be.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
2.4.91 What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
Speaker CORIN
2.4.92 That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
2.4.93 That little cares for buying anything.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
2.4.94 I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,
2.4.95 Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock,
2.4.96 And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
Speaker CELIA
Stage Directions , as Aliena
2.4.97 And we will mend thy wages. I like this place,
2.4.98 And willingly could waste my time in it.
Speaker CORIN
2.4.99 Assuredly the thing is to be sold.
2.4.100 Go with me. If you like upon report
2.4.101 The soil, the profit, and this kind of life,
2.4.102 I will your very faithful feeder be
2.4.103 And buy it with your gold right suddenly.

Speaker AMIENS
Stage Directions  singsUnder the greenwood treeWho loves to lie with meAnd turn his merry noteUnto the sweet bird’s throat,Come hither, come hither, come hither.Here shall he seeNo enemyBut winter and rough weather.
Speaker JAQUES
2.5.9 More, more, I prithee, more.
Speaker AMIENS
2.5.10 It will make you melancholy, Monsieur
2.5.11 Jaques.
Speaker JAQUES
2.5.12 I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck
2.5.13 melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs.
2.5.14 More, I prithee, more.
Speaker AMIENS
2.5.15 My voice is ragged. I know I cannot please you.
Speaker JAQUES
2.5.16 I do not desire you to please me. I do desire
2.5.17 you to sing. Come, more, another stanzo. Call you
2.5.18 ’em stanzos?
Speaker AMIENS
2.5.19 What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
Speaker JAQUES
2.5.20 Nay, I care not for their names. They owe me
2.5.21 nothing. Will you sing?
Speaker AMIENS
2.5.22 More at your request than to please myself.
Speaker JAQUES
2.5.23 Well then, if ever I thank any man, I’ll thank
2.5.24 you. But that they call compliment is like th’
2.5.25 encounter of two dog-apes. And when a man thanks
2.5.26 me heartily, methinks I have given him a penny and
2.5.27 he renders me the beggarly thanks. Come, sing. And
2.5.28 you that will not, hold your tongues.
Speaker AMIENS
2.5.29 Well, I’ll end the song.—Sirs, cover the while;
2.5.30 the Duke will drink under this tree.—He hath been
2.5.31 all this day to look you.
Speaker JAQUES
2.5.32 And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is
2.5.33 too disputable for my company. I think of as many
2.5.34 matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no
2.5.35 boast of them. Come, warble, come.
Speaker ALL
Stage Directions  together here.Who doth ambition shunAnd loves to live i’ th’ sun,Seeking the food he eatsAnd pleased with what he gets,Come hither, come hither, come hither.Here shall he seeNo enemyBut winter and rough weather.
Speaker JAQUES
2.5.44 I’ll give you a verse to this note that I made
2.5.45 yesterday in despite of my invention.
Speaker AMIENS
2.5.46 And I’ll sing it.
Speaker JAQUES
2.5.47 Thus it goes:If it do come to passThat any man turn ass,Leaving his wealth and easeA stubborn will to please,Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame.Here shall he seeGross fools as he,An if he will come to me.
Speaker AMIENS
2.5.56 What’s that ducdame?
Speaker JAQUES
2.5.57 ’Tis a Greek invocation to call fools into a
2.5.58 circle. I’ll go sleep if I can. If I cannot, I’ll rail
2.5.59 against all the first-born of Egypt.
Speaker AMIENS
2.5.60 And I’ll go seek the Duke. His banquet is
2.5.61 prepared.
Stage Directions They exit.Scene 2

Stage Directions Enter Orlando and Adam.
Speaker ADAM
2.6.1 Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for
2.6.2 food. Here lie I down and measure out my grave.
2.6.3 Farewell, kind master.
Stage Directions He lies down.
Speaker ORLANDO
2.6.4 Why, how now, Adam? No greater heart in
2.6.5 thee? Live a little, comfort a little, cheer thyself a
2.6.6 little. If this uncouth forest yield anything savage, I
2.6.7 will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee.
2.6.8 Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers. For my
2.6.9 sake, be comfortable. Hold death awhile at the
2.6.10 arm’s end. I will here be with thee presently, and if
2.6.11 I bring thee not something to eat, I will give thee
2.6.12 leave to die. But if thou diest before I come, thou art
2.6.13 a mocker of my labor. Well said. Thou look’st
2.6.14 cheerly, and I’ll be with thee quickly. Yet thou liest
2.6.15 in the bleak air. Come, I will bear thee to some
2.6.16 shelter, and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner if
2.6.17 there live anything in this desert. Cheerly, good
2.6.18 Adam.
Stage Directions They exit.Scene 2

Stage Directions Enter Duke Senior and Lords, like outlaws.
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
2.7.1 I think he be transformed into a beast,
2.7.2 For I can nowhere find him like a man.
Speaker FIRST LORD
2.7.3 My lord, he is but even now gone hence.
2.7.4 Here was he merry, hearing of a song.
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
2.7.5 If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
2.7.6 We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
2.7.7 Go seek him. Tell him I would speak with him.
Stage Directions Enter Jaques.
Speaker FIRST LORD
2.7.8 He saves my labor by his own approach.
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
Stage Directions , to Jaques
2.7.9 Why, how now, monsieur? What a life is this
2.7.10 That your poor friends must woo your company?
2.7.11 What, you look merrily.
Speaker JAQUES
2.7.12 A fool, a fool, I met a fool i’ th’ forest,
2.7.13 A motley fool. A miserable world!
2.7.14 As I do live by food, I met a fool,
2.7.15 Who laid him down and basked him in the sun
2.7.16 And railed on Lady Fortune in good terms,
2.7.17 In good set terms, and yet a motley fool.
2.7.18 Good morrow, fool, quoth I. No, sir, quoth he,
2.7.19 Call me not fool till heaven hath sent mefortune.
2.7.21 And then he drew a dial from his poke
2.7.22 And, looking on it with lack-luster eye,
2.7.23 Says very wisely It is ten o’clock.Thus we may see, quoth he, how the world wags.’Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,And after one hour more ’twill be eleven.And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe,And then from hour to hour we rot and rot,And thereby hangs a tale. When I did hear
2.7.30 The motley fool thus moral on the time,
2.7.31 My lungs began to crow like chanticleer
2.7.32 That fools should be so deep-contemplative,
2.7.33 And I did laugh sans intermission
2.7.34 An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
2.7.35 A worthy fool! Motley’s the only wear.
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
2.7.36 What fool is this?
Speaker JAQUES
2.7.37 O worthy fool!—One that hath been a courtier,
2.7.38 And says If ladies be but young and fair,They have the gift to know it. And in his brain,
2.7.40 Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
2.7.41 After a voyage, he hath strange places crammed
2.7.42 With observation, the which he vents
2.7.43 In mangled forms. O, that I were a fool!
2.7.44 I am ambitious for a motley coat.
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
2.7.45 Thou shalt have one.
Speaker JAQUES
2.7.46 It is my only suit,
2.7.47 Provided that you weed your better judgments
2.7.48 Of all opinion that grows rank in them
2.7.49 That I am wise. I must have liberty
2.7.50 Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
2.7.51 To blow on whom I please, for so fools have.
2.7.52 And they that are most gallèd with my folly,
2.7.53 They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
2.7.54 The why is plain as way to parish church:
2.7.55 He that a fool doth very wisely hit
2.7.56 Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
2.7.57 Not to seem senseless of the bob. If not,
2.7.58 The wise man’s folly is anatomized
2.7.59 Even by the squand’ring glances of the fool.
2.7.60 Invest me in my motley. Give me leave
2.7.61 To speak my mind, and I will through and through
2.7.62 Cleanse the foul body of th’ infected world,
2.7.63 If they will patiently receive my medicine.
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
2.7.64 Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.
Speaker JAQUES
2.7.65 What, for a counter, would I do but good?
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
2.7.66 Most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin;
2.7.67 For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
2.7.68 As sensual as the brutish sting itself,
2.7.69 And all th’ embossèd sores and headed evils
2.7.70 That thou with license of free foot hast caught
2.7.71 Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.
Speaker JAQUES
2.7.72 Why, who cries out on pride
2.7.73 That can therein tax any private party?
2.7.74 Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea
2.7.75 Till that the weary very means do ebb?
2.7.76 What woman in the city do I name
2.7.77 When that I say the city-woman bears
2.7.78 The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
2.7.79 Who can come in and say that I mean her,
2.7.80 When such a one as she such is her neighbor?
2.7.81 Or what is he of basest function
2.7.82 That says his bravery is not on my cost,
2.7.83 Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
2.7.84 His folly to the mettle of my speech?
2.7.85 There then. How then, what then? Let me see
2.7.86 wherein
2.7.87 My tongue hath wronged him. If it do him right,
2.7.88 Then he hath wronged himself. If he be free,
2.7.89 Why then my taxing like a wild goose flies
2.7.90 Unclaimed of any man.Enter Orlando, brandishing a sword.
2.7.91 But who comes here?
Stage Directions Enter Orlando, brandishing a sword.
Speaker ORLANDO
2.7.92 Forbear, and eat no more.
Speaker JAQUES
2.7.93 Why, I have eat none yet.
Speaker ORLANDO
2.7.94 Nor shalt not till necessity be served.
Speaker JAQUES
2.7.95 Of what kind should this cock come of?
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
Stage Directions , to Orlando
2.7.96 Art thou thus boldened, man, by thy distress,
2.7.97 Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
2.7.98 That in civility thou seem’st so empty?
Speaker ORLANDO
2.7.99 You touched my vein at first. The thorny point
2.7.100 Of bare distress hath ta’en from me the show
2.7.101 Of smooth civility, yet am I inland bred
2.7.102 And know some nurture. But forbear, I say.
2.7.103 He dies that touches any of this fruit
2.7.104 Till I and my affairs are answerèd.
Speaker JAQUES
2.7.105 An you will not be answered with reason, I
2.7.106 must die.
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
Stage Directions , to Orlando
2.7.107 What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
2.7.108 More than your force move us to gentleness.
Speaker ORLANDO
2.7.109 I almost die for food, and let me have it.
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
2.7.110 Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
Speaker ORLANDO
2.7.111 Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you.
2.7.112 I thought that all things had been savage here,
2.7.113 And therefore put I on the countenance
2.7.114 Of stern commandment. But whate’er you are
2.7.115 That in this desert inaccessible,
2.7.116 Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
2.7.117 Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time,
2.7.118 If ever you have looked on better days,
2.7.119 If ever been where bells have knolled to church,
2.7.120 If ever sat at any good man’s feast,
2.7.121 If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
2.7.122 And know what ’tis to pity and be pitied,
2.7.123 Let gentleness my strong enforcement be,
2.7.124 In the which hope I blush and hide my sword.
Stage Directions He sheathes his sword.
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
2.7.125 True is it that we have seen better days,
2.7.126 And have with holy bell been knolled to church,
2.7.127 And sat at good men’s feasts and wiped our eyes
2.7.128 Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered.
2.7.129 And therefore sit you down in gentleness,
2.7.130 And take upon command what help we have
2.7.131 That to your wanting may be ministered.
Speaker ORLANDO
2.7.132 Then but forbear your food a little while
2.7.133 Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn
2.7.134 And give it food. There is an old poor man
2.7.135 Who after me hath many a weary step
2.7.136 Limped in pure love. Till he be first sufficed,
2.7.137 Oppressed with two weak evils, age and hunger,
2.7.138 I will not touch a bit.
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
2.7.139 Go find him out,
2.7.140 And we will nothing waste till you return.
Speaker ORLANDO
2.7.141 I thank you; and be blessed for your good comfort.
Stage Directions He exits.
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
2.7.142 Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy.
2.7.143 This wide and universal theater
2.7.144 Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
2.7.145 Wherein we play in.
Speaker JAQUES
2.7.146 All the world’s a stage,
2.7.147 And all the men and women merely players.
2.7.148 They have their exits and their entrances,
2.7.149 And one man in his time plays many parts,
2.7.150 His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
2.7.151 Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms.
2.7.152 Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel
2.7.153 And shining morning face, creeping like snail
2.7.154 Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
2.7.155 Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
2.7.156 Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,
2.7.157 Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
2.7.158 Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
2.7.159 Seeking the bubble reputation
2.7.160 Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,
2.7.161 In fair round belly with good capon lined,
2.7.162 With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
2.7.163 Full of wise saws and modern instances;
2.7.164 And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
2.7.165 Into the lean and slippered pantaloon
2.7.166 With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
2.7.167 His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
2.7.168 For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
2.7.169 Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
2.7.170 And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
2.7.171 That ends this strange eventful history,
2.7.172 Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
2.7.173 Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.Enter Orlando, carrying Adam.
Stage Directions Enter Orlando, carrying Adam.
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
2.7.174 Welcome. Set down your venerable burden,
2.7.175 And let him feed.
Speaker ORLANDO
2.7.176 I thank you most for him.
Speaker ADAM
2.7.177 So had you need.—
2.7.178 I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
2.7.179 Welcome. Fall to. I will not trouble you
2.7.180 As yet to question you about your fortunes.—
2.7.181 Give us some music, and, good cousin, sing.
Stage Directions The Duke and Orlando continue their conversation,apart.
Speaker AMIENS
Stage Directions  singsBlow, blow, thou winter wind.Thou art not so unkindAs man’s ingratitude.Thy tooth is not so keen,Because thou art not seen,Although thy breath be rude.Heigh-ho, sing heigh-ho, unto the green holly.Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.Then heigh-ho, the holly.This life is most jolly.Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,That dost not bite so nighAs benefits forgot.Though thou the waters warp,Thy sting is not so sharpAs friend remembered not.Heigh-ho, sing heigh-ho, unto the green holly.Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.Then heigh-ho, the holly.This life is most jolly.

2.7.205 Most truly limned and living in your face,
2.7.206 Be truly welcome hither. I am the duke
2.7.207 That loved your father. The residue of your fortune

3.1.1 Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be.
3.1.2 But were I not the better part made mercy,
3.1.3 I should not seek an absent argument
3.1.4 Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:
3.1.5 Find out thy brother wheresoe’er he is.
3.1.6 Seek him with candle. Bring him, dead or living,
3.1.7 Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more
3.1.8 To seek a living in our territory.
3.1.9 Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine,
3.1.10 Worth seizure, do we seize into our hands
3.1.11 Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother’s mouth
3.1.12 Of what we think against thee.
Speaker OLIVER
3.1.13 O, that your Highness knew my heart in this:
3.1.14 I never loved my brother in my life.
Speaker DUKE FREDERICK
3.1.15 More villain thou.—Well, push him out of doors,
3.1.16 And let my officers of such a nature
3.1.17 Make an extent upon his house and lands.

1 O Rosalind, these trees shall be my books,
3.2.6 
2 And in their barks my thoughts I’ll character,
3.2.7 
3 That every eye which in this forest looks
3.2.8 
4 Shall see thy virtue witnessed everywhere.
3.2.9 
1 Run, run, Orlando, carve on every tree
3.2.10 
2 The fair, the chaste, and unexpressive she.
Stage Directions He exits.
Stage Directions Enter Corin and Touchstone.
Speaker CORIN
3.2.11 And how like you this shepherd’s life, Master
3.2.12 Touchstone?
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.2.13 Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a
3.2.14 good life; but in respect that it is a shepherd’s life, it
3.2.15 is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I like it very
3.2.16 well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile
3.2.17 life. Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me
3.2.18 well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is
3.2.19 tedious. As it is a spare life, look you, it fits my
3.2.20 humor well; but as there is no more plenty in it, it
3.2.21 goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy
3.2.22 in thee, shepherd?
Speaker CORIN
3.2.23 No more but that I know the more one sickens,
3.2.24 the worse at ease he is, and that he that wants
3.2.25 money, means, and content is without three good
3.2.26 friends; that the property of rain is to wet, and fire
3.2.27 to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that
3.2.28 a great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he
3.2.29 that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
3.2.30 complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull
3.2.31 kindred.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.2.32 Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast
3.2.33 ever in court, shepherd?
Speaker CORIN
3.2.34 No, truly.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.2.35 Then thou art damned.
Speaker CORIN
3.2.36 Nay, I hope.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.2.37 Truly, thou art damned, like an ill-roasted
3.2.38 egg, all on one side.
Speaker CORIN
3.2.39 For not being at court? Your reason.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.2.40 Why, if thou never wast at court, thou
3.2.41 never saw’st good manners; if thou never saw’st
3.2.42 good manners, then thy manners must be wicked,
3.2.43 and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou
3.2.44 art in a parlous state, shepherd.
Speaker CORIN
3.2.45 Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good
3.2.46 manners at the court are as ridiculous in the
3.2.47 country as the behavior of the country is most
3.2.48 mockable at the court. You told me you salute not at
3.2.49 the court but you kiss your hands. That courtesy
3.2.50 would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.2.51 Instance, briefly. Come, instance.
Speaker CORIN
3.2.52 Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their
3.2.53 fells, you know, are greasy.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.2.54 Why, do not your courtier’s hands sweat?
3.2.55 And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as
3.2.56 the sweat of a man? Shallow, shallow. A better
3.2.57 instance, I say. Come.
Speaker CORIN
3.2.58 Besides, our hands are hard.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.2.59 Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow
3.2.60 again. A more sounder instance. Come.
Speaker CORIN
3.2.61 And they are often tarred over with the surgery
3.2.62 of our sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The
3.2.63 courtier’s hands are perfumed with civet.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.2.64 Most shallow man. Thou worms’ meat in
3.2.65 respect of a good piece of flesh, indeed. Learn of the
3.2.66 wise and perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar,
3.2.67 the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance,
3.2.68 shepherd.
Speaker CORIN
3.2.69 You have too courtly a wit for me. I’ll rest.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.2.70 Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee,
3.2.71 shallow man. God make incision in thee; thou art
3.2.72 raw.
Speaker CORIN
3.2.73 Sir, I am a true laborer. I earn that I eat, get that
3.2.74 I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man’s happiness,
3.2.75 glad of other men’s good, content with my harm,
3.2.76 and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze
3.2.77 and my lambs suck.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.2.78 That is another simple sin in you, to bring
3.2.79 the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get
3.2.80 your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to
3.2.81 a bell-wether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth
3.2.82 to a crooked-pated old cuckoldly ram, out of
3.2.83 all reasonable match. If thou be’st not damned for
3.2.84 this, the devil himself will have no shepherds. I
3.2.85 cannot see else how thou shouldst ’scape.
Stage Directions Enter Rosalind, as Ganymede.
Speaker CORIN
3.2.86 Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new
3.2.87 mistress’s brother.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede, reading a paper
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
Stage Directions , reading a paperFrom the east to western IndNo jewel is like Rosalind.Her worth being mounted on the wind,Through all the world bears Rosalind.All the pictures fairest linedAre but black to Rosalind.Let no face be kept in mindBut the fair of Rosalind.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.2.96 I’ll rhyme you so eight years together,
3.2.97 dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted.
3.2.98 It is the right butter-women’s rank to market.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.99 Out, fool.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.2.100 For a taste:If a hart do lack a hind,Let him seek out Rosalind.If the cat will after kind,So be sure will Rosalind.Wintered garments must be lined;So must slender Rosalind.They that reap must sheaf and bind;Then to cart with Rosalind.Sweetest nut hath sourest rind;Such a nut is Rosalind.He that sweetest rose will findMust find love’s prick, and Rosalind.
3.2.113 This is the very false gallop of verses. Why do you
3.2.114 infect yourself with them?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.115 Peace, you dull fool. I found
3.2.116 them on a tree.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.2.117 Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.118 I’ll graft it with you, and
3.2.119 then I shall graft it with a medlar. Then it will be
3.2.120 the earliest fruit i’ th’ country, for you’ll be rotten
3.2.121 ere you be half ripe, and that’s the right virtue of
3.2.122 the medlar.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.2.123 You have said, but whether wisely or no,
3.2.124 let the forest judge.
Stage Directions Enter Celia, as Aliena, with a writing.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.125 Peace. Here comes my sister
3.2.126 reading. Stand aside.
Speaker CELIA
Stage Directions , as Aliena, reads
Stage Directions as Aliena
Stage Directions readsWhy should this a desert be?For it is unpeopled? No.Tongues I’ll hang on every treeThat shall civil sayings show.Some how brief the life of manRuns his erring pilgrimage,ACT 3. SC. 2That the stretching of a spanBuckles in his sum of age;Some of violated vows’Twixt the souls of friend and friend.But upon the fairest boughs,Or at every sentence’sentence end,Will I Rosalinda write,Teaching all that read to knowThe quintessence of every spriteHeaven would in little show.Therefore heaven nature chargedThat one body should be filledWith all graces wide-enlarged.Nature presently distilledHelen’s cheek, but not her heart,Cleopatra’s majesty,Atalanta’s better part,Sad Lucretia’s modesty.Thus Rosalind of many partsBy heavenly synod was devisedOf many faces, eyes, and heartsTo have the touches dearest prized.Heaven would that she these gifts should haveAnd I to live and die her slave.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.157 O most gentle Jupiter, what
3.2.158 tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners
3.2.159 withal, and never cried Have patience,good people!.
Speaker CELIA
Stage Directions , as Aliena
3.2.161 How now?—Back, friends. Shepherd,
3.2.162 go off a little.—Go with him, sirrah.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.2.163 Come, shepherd, let us make an honorable
3.2.164 retreat, though not with bag and baggage, yet
3.2.165 with scrip and scrippage.
Stage Directions Touchstone and Corin exit.
Speaker CELIA
3.2.166 Didst thou hear these verses?
Speaker ROSALIND
3.2.167 O yes, I heard them all, and more too, for
3.2.168 some of them had in them more feet than the verses
3.2.169 would bear.
Speaker CELIA
3.2.170 That’s no matter. The feet might bear the verses.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.2.171 Ay, but the feet were lame and could not
3.2.172 bear themselves without the verse, and therefore
3.2.173 stood lamely in the verse.
Speaker CELIA
3.2.174 But didst thou hear without wondering how thy
3.2.175 name should be hanged and carved upon these
3.2.176 trees?
Speaker ROSALIND
3.2.177 I was seven of the nine days out of the
3.2.178 wonder before you came, for look here what I
3.2.179 found on a palm tree. She shows the paper sheread. 
3.2.180 I was never so berhymed since Pythagoras’
3.2.181 time that I was an Irish rat, which I can hardly
3.2.182 remember.
Stage Directions  She shows the paper sheread. 
Speaker CELIA
3.2.183 Trow you who hath done this?
Speaker ROSALIND
3.2.184 Is it a man?
Speaker CELIA
3.2.185 And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
3.2.186 Change you color?
Speaker ROSALIND
3.2.187 I prithee, who?
Speaker CELIA
3.2.188 O Lord, Lord, it is a hard matter for friends to
3.2.189 meet, but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
3.2.190 and so encounter.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.2.191 Nay, but who is it?
Speaker CELIA
3.2.192 Is it possible?
Speaker ROSALIND
3.2.193 Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary
3.2.194 vehemence, tell me who it is.
Speaker CELIA
3.2.195 O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful
3.2.196 wonderful, and yet again wonderful, and after that
3.2.197 out of all whooping!
Speaker ROSALIND
3.2.198 Good my complexion, dost thou think
3.2.199 though I am caparisoned like a man, I have a
3.2.200 doublet and hose in my disposition? One inch of
3.2.201 delay more is a South Sea of discovery. I prithee,
3.2.202 tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. I would
3.2.203 thou couldst stammer, that thou might’st pour this
3.2.204 concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out
3.2.205 of a narrow-mouthed bottle—either too much at
3.2.206 once, or none at all. I prithee take the cork out of
3.2.207 thy mouth, that I may drink thy tidings.
Speaker CELIA
3.2.208 So you may put a man in your belly.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.2.209 Is he of God’s making? What manner of
3.2.210 man? Is his head worth a hat, or his chin worth a
3.2.211 beard?
Speaker CELIA
3.2.212 Nay, he hath but a little beard.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.2.213 Why, God will send more, if the man will be
3.2.214 thankful. Let me stay the growth of his beard, if
3.2.215 thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.
Speaker CELIA
3.2.216 It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler’s
3.2.217 heels and your heart both in an instant.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.2.218 Nay, but the devil take mocking. Speak sad
3.2.219 brow and true maid.
Speaker CELIA
3.2.220 I’ faith, coz, ’tis he.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.2.221 Orlando?
Speaker CELIA
3.2.222 Orlando.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.2.223 Alas the day, what shall I do with my doublet
3.2.224 and hose? What did he when thou saw’st him? What
3.2.225 said he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What
3.2.226 makes he here? Did he ask for me? Where remains
3.2.227 he? How parted he with thee? And when shalt thou
3.2.228 see him again? Answer me in one word.
Speaker CELIA
3.2.229 You must borrow me Gargantua’s mouth first.
3.2.230 ’Tis a word too great for any mouth of this age’s size.
3.2.231 To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
3.2.232 answer in a catechism.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.2.233 But doth he know that I am in this forest and
3.2.234 in man’s apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the
3.2.235 day he wrestled?
Speaker CELIA
3.2.236 It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
3.2.237 propositions of a lover. But take a taste of my
3.2.238 finding him, and relish it with good observance. I
3.2.239 found him under a tree like a dropped acorn.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.2.240 It may well be called Jove’s tree when it
3.2.241 drops forth such fruit.
Speaker CELIA
3.2.242 Give me audience, good madam.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.2.243 Proceed.
Speaker CELIA
3.2.244 There lay he, stretched along like a wounded
3.2.245 knight.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.2.246 Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well
3.2.247 becomes the ground.
Speaker CELIA
3.2.248 Cry holla to thy tongue, I prithee. It curvets
3.2.249 unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.2.250 O, ominous! He comes to kill my heart.
Speaker CELIA
3.2.251 I would sing my song without a burden. Thou
3.2.252 bring’st me out of tune.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.2.253 Do you not know I am a woman? When I
3.2.254 think, I must speak. Sweet, say on.
Speaker CELIA
3.2.255 You bring me out.Enter Orlando and Jaques.
3.2.256 Soft, comes he not here?
Stage Directions Enter Orlando and Jaques.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.2.257 ’Tis he. Slink by, and note him.
Stage Directions Rosalind and Celia step aside.
Speaker JAQUES
Stage Directions , to Orlando
3.2.258 I thank you for your company,
3.2.259 but, good faith, I had as lief have been myself alone.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.260 And so had I, but yet, for fashion sake, I
3.2.261 thank you too for your society.
Speaker JAQUES
3.2.262 God be wi’ you. Let’s meet as little as we can.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.263 I do desire we may be better strangers.
Speaker JAQUES
3.2.264 I pray you mar no more trees with writing love
3.2.265 songs in their barks.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.266 I pray you mar no more of my verses with
3.2.267 reading them ill-favoredly.
Speaker JAQUES
3.2.268 Rosalind is your love’s name?
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.269 Yes, just.
Speaker JAQUES
3.2.270 I do not like her name.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.271 There was no thought of pleasing you when
3.2.272 she was christened.
Speaker JAQUES
3.2.273 What stature is she of?
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.274 Just as high as my heart.
Speaker JAQUES
3.2.275 You are full of pretty answers. Have you not
3.2.276 been acquainted with goldsmiths’ wives and
3.2.277 conned them out of rings?
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.278 Not so. But I answer you right painted cloth,
3.2.279 from whence you have studied your questions.
Speaker JAQUES
3.2.280 You have a nimble wit. I think ’twas made of
3.2.281 Atalanta’s heels. Will you sit down with me? And we
3.2.282 two will rail against our mistress the world and all
3.2.283 our misery.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.284 I will chide no breather in the world but
3.2.285 myself, against whom I know most faults.
Speaker JAQUES
3.2.286 The worst fault you have is to be in love.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.287 ’Tis a fault I will not change for your best
3.2.288 virtue. I am weary of you.
Speaker JAQUES
3.2.289 By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I
3.2.290 found you.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.291 He is drowned in the brook. Look but in, and
3.2.292 you shall see him.
Speaker JAQUES
3.2.293 There I shall see mine own figure.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.294 Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
Speaker JAQUES
3.2.295 I’ll tarry no longer with you. Farewell, good
3.2.296 Signior Love.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.297 I am glad of your departure. Adieu, good
3.2.298 Monsieur Melancholy.
Stage Directions Jaques exits.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , aside to Celia
3.2.299 I will speak to him like a
3.2.300 saucy lackey, and under that habit play the knave
3.2.301 with him. As Ganymede. Do you hear, forester?
Stage Directions As Ganymede. 
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.302 Very well. What would you?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.303 I pray you, what is ’t
3.2.304 o’clock?
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.305 You should ask me what time o’ day. There’s
3.2.306 no clock in the forest.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.307 Then there is no true lover
3.2.308 in the forest; else sighing every minute and
3.2.309 groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of
3.2.310 time as well as a clock.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.311 And why not the swift foot of time? Had not
3.2.312 that been as proper?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.313 By no means, sir. Time
3.2.314 travels in divers paces with divers persons. I’ll tell
3.2.315 you who time ambles withal, who time trots withal,
3.2.316 who time gallops withal, and who he stands still
3.2.317 withal.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.318 I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.319 Marry, he trots hard with a
3.2.320 young maid between the contract of her marriage
3.2.321 and the day it is solemnized. If the interim be but a
3.2.322 se’nnight, time’s pace is so hard that it seems the
3.2.323 length of seven year.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.324 Who ambles time withal?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.325 With a priest that lacks Latin
3.2.326 and a rich man that hath not the gout, for the one
3.2.327 sleeps easily because he cannot study, and the other
3.2.328 lives merrily because he feels no pain—the one
3.2.329 lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning,
3.2.330 the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious
3.2.331 penury. These time ambles withal.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.332 Who doth he gallop withal?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.333 With a thief to the gallows,
3.2.334 for though he go as softly as foot can fall, he thinks
3.2.335 himself too soon there.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.336 Who stays it still withal?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.337 With lawyers in the vacation,
3.2.338 for they sleep between term and term, and
3.2.339 then they perceive not how time moves.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.340 Where dwell you, pretty youth?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.341 With this shepherdess, my
3.2.342 sister, here in the skirts of the forest, like fringe
3.2.343 upon a petticoat.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.344 Are you native of this place?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.345 As the cony that you see
3.2.346 dwell where she is kindled.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.347 Your accent is something finer than you
3.2.348 could purchase in so removed a dwelling.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.349 I have been told so of many.
3.2.350 But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught
3.2.351 me to speak, who was in his youth an inland man,
3.2.352 one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in
3.2.353 love. I have heard him read many lectures against it,
3.2.354 and I thank God I am not a woman, to be touched
3.2.355 with so many giddy offenses as he hath generally
3.2.356 taxed their whole sex withal.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.357 Can you remember any of the principal evils
3.2.358 that he laid to the charge of women?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.359 There were none principal.
3.2.360 They were all like one another as halfpence are,
3.2.361 every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow
3.2.362 fault came to match it.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.363 I prithee recount some of them.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.364 No, I will not cast away my
3.2.365 physic but on those that are sick. There is a man
3.2.366 haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with
3.2.367 carving Rosalind on their barks, hangs odes upon
3.2.368 hawthorns and elegies on brambles, all, forsooth,
3.2.369 deifying the name of Rosalind. If I could meet
3.2.370 that fancy-monger, I would give him some good
3.2.371 counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love
3.2.372 upon him.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.373 I am he that is so love-shaked. I pray you tell
3.2.374 me your remedy.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.375 There is none of my uncle’s
3.2.376 marks upon you. He taught me how to know a man
3.2.377 in love, in which cage of rushes I am sure you are
3.2.378 not prisoner.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.379 What were his marks?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.380 A lean cheek, which you
3.2.381 have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have
3.2.382 not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a
3.2.383 beard neglected, which you have not—but I pardon
3.2.384 you for that, for simply your having in beard is a
3.2.385 younger brother’s revenue. Then your hose should
3.2.386 be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve
3.2.387 unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything
3.2.388 about you demonstrating a careless desolation. But
3.2.389 you are no such man. You are rather point-device in
3.2.390 your accouterments, as loving yourself than seeming
3.2.391 the lover of any other.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.392 Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe
3.2.393 I love.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.394 Me believe it? You may as
3.2.395 soon make her that you love believe it, which I
3.2.396 warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does.
3.2.397 That is one of the points in the which women still
3.2.398 give the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth,
3.2.399 are you he that hangs the verses on the trees
3.2.400 wherein Rosalind is so admired?
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.401 I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of
3.2.402 Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.403 But are you so much in love
3.2.404 as your rhymes speak?
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.405 Neither rhyme nor reason can express how
3.2.406 much.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.407 Love is merely a madness,
3.2.408 and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a
3.2.409 whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are
3.2.410 not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so
3.2.411 ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I
3.2.412 profess curing it by counsel.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.413 Did you ever cure any so?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.414 Yes, one, and in this manner.
3.2.415 He was to imagine me his love, his mistress,
3.2.416 and I set him every day to woo me; at which time
3.2.417 would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be
3.2.418 effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud,
3.2.419 fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears,
3.2.420 full of smiles; for every passion something, and for
3.2.421 no passion truly anything, as boys and women are,
3.2.422 for the most part, cattle of this color; would now
3.2.423 like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then
3.2.424 forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him,
3.2.425 that I drave my suitor from his mad humor of love
3.2.426 to a living humor of madness, which was to forswear
3.2.427 the full stream of the world and to live in a
3.2.428 nook merely monastic. And thus I cured him, and
3.2.429 this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as
3.2.430 clean as a sound sheep’s heart, that there shall not
3.2.431 be one spot of love in ’t.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.432 I would not be cured, youth.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.433 I would cure you if you
3.2.434 would but call me Rosalind and come every day to
3.2.435 my cote and woo me.
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.436 Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me
3.2.437 where it is.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.438 Go with me to it, and I’ll
3.2.439 show it you; and by the way you shall tell me where
3.2.440 in the forest you live. Will you go?
Speaker ORLANDO
3.2.441 With all my heart, good youth.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.2.442 Nay, you must call me
3.2.443 Rosalind.—Come, sister, will you go?
Stage Directions They exit.Scene 3

Stage Directions Enter Touchstone and Audrey, followed by Jaques.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.3.1 Come apace, good Audrey. I will fetch up
3.3.2 your goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? Am I the
3.3.3 man yet? Doth my simple feature content you?
Speaker AUDREY
3.3.4 Your features, Lord warrant us! What
3.3.5 features?
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.3.6 I am here with thee and thy goats, as the
3.3.7 most capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the
3.3.8 Goths.
Speaker JAQUES
Stage Directions , aside
3.3.9 O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than
3.3.10 Jove in a thatched house.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.3.11 When a man’s verses cannot be understood,
3.3.12 nor a man’s good wit seconded with the
3.3.13 forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more
3.3.14 dead than a great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I
3.3.15 would the gods had made thee poetical.
Speaker AUDREY
3.3.16 I do not know what poetical is. Is it honest
3.3.17 in deed and word? Is it a true thing?
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.3.18 No, truly, for the truest poetry is the most
3.3.19 feigning, and lovers are given to poetry, and what
3.3.20 they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do
3.3.21 feign.
Speaker AUDREY
3.3.22 Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me
3.3.23 poetical?
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.3.24 I do, truly, for thou swear’st to me thou
3.3.25 art honest. Now if thou wert a poet, I might have
3.3.26 some hope thou didst feign.
Speaker AUDREY
3.3.27 Would you not have me honest?
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.3.28 No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favored;
3.3.29 for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a
3.3.30 sauce to sugar.
Speaker JAQUES
Stage Directions , aside
3.3.31 A material fool.
Speaker AUDREY
3.3.32 Well, I am not fair, and therefore I pray the
3.3.33 gods make me honest.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.3.34 Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a
3.3.35 foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean
3.3.36 dish.
Speaker AUDREY
3.3.37 I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am
3.3.38 foul.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.3.39 Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness;
3.3.40 sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may
3.3.41 be, I will marry thee; and to that end I have been
3.3.42 with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next village,
3.3.43 who hath promised to meet me in this place of the
3.3.44 forest and to couple us.
Speaker JAQUES
Stage Directions , aside
3.3.45 I would fain see this meeting.
Speaker AUDREY
3.3.46 Well, the gods give us joy.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.3.47 Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful
3.3.48 heart, stagger in this attempt, for here we have no
3.3.49 temple but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts.
3.3.50 But what though? Courage. As horns are odious,
3.3.51 they are necessary. It is said Many a man knows noend of his goods. Right: many a man has good
3.3.53 horns and knows no end of them. Well, that is the
3.3.54 dowry of his wife; ’tis none of his own getting.
3.3.55 Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no. The
3.3.56 noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the
3.3.57 single man therefore blessed? No. As a walled town
3.3.58 is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of
3.3.59 a married man more honorable than the bare brow
3.3.60 of a bachelor. And by how much defense is better
3.3.61 than no skill, by so much is a horn more precious
3.3.62 than to want.Enter Sir Oliver Martext.
3.3.63 Here comes Sir Oliver.—Sir Oliver Martext, you are
3.3.64 well met. Will you dispatch us here under this tree,
3.3.65 or shall we go with you to your chapel?
Stage Directions Enter Sir Oliver Martext.
Speaker OLIVER MARTEXT
3.3.66 Is there none here to give the
3.3.67 woman?
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.3.68 I will not take her on gift of any man.
Speaker OLIVER MARTEXT
3.3.69 Truly, she must be given, or the
3.3.70 marriage is not lawful.
Speaker JAQUES
Stage Directions , coming forward
3.3.71 Proceed, proceed. I’ll give
3.3.72 her.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.3.73 Good even, good Monsieur What-you-call-’t.
3.3.74 How do you, sir? You are very well met. God
3.3.75 ’ild you for your last company. I am very glad to see
3.3.76 you. Even a toy in hand here, sir. Nay, pray be
3.3.77 covered.
Speaker JAQUES
3.3.78 Will you be married, motley?
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.3.79 As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his
3.3.80 curb, and the falcon her bells, so man hath his
3.3.81 desires; and as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be
3.3.82 nibbling.
Speaker JAQUES
3.3.83 And will you, being a man of your breeding, be
3.3.84 married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to
3.3.85 church, and have a good priest that can tell you
3.3.86 what marriage is. This fellow will but join you
3.3.87 together as they join wainscot. Then one of you will
3.3.88 prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp,
3.3.89 warp.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.3.90 I am not in the mind but I were better to
3.3.91 be married of him than of another, for he is not like
3.3.92 to marry me well, and not being well married, it
3.3.93 will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my
3.3.94 wife.
Speaker JAQUES
3.3.95 Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
3.3.96 Come, sweet Audrey. We must be married,
3.3.97 or we must live in bawdry.—Farewell, good
3.3.98 Master Oliver, notO sweet Oliver,O brave Oliver,Leave me not behind thee,
3.3.102 ButWind away,Begone, I say,I will not to wedding with thee.
Stage Directions Audrey, Touchstone, and Jaques exit.
Speaker OLIVER MARTEXT
3.3.106 ’Tis no matter. Ne’er a fantastical
3.3.107 knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling.
Stage Directions He exits.Scene 3

Stage Directions Enter Rosalind, dressed as Ganymede, and Celia,dressed as Aliena.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.4.1 Never talk to me. I will weep.
Speaker CELIA
3.4.2 Do, I prithee, but yet have the grace to consider
3.4.3 that tears do not become a man.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.4.4 But have I not cause to weep?
Speaker CELIA
3.4.5 As good cause as one would desire. Therefore
3.4.6 weep.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.4.7 His very hair is of the dissembling color.
Speaker CELIA
3.4.8 Something browner than Judas’s. Marry, his
3.4.9 kisses are Judas’s own children.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.4.10 I’ faith, his hair is of a good color.
Speaker CELIA
3.4.11 An excellent color. Your chestnut was ever the
3.4.12 only color.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.4.13 And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the
3.4.14 touch of holy bread.
Speaker CELIA
3.4.15 He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A
3.4.16 nun of winter’s sisterhood kisses not more religiously.
3.4.17 The very ice of chastity is in them.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.4.18 But why did he swear he would come this
3.4.19 morning, and comes not?
Speaker CELIA
3.4.20 Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.4.21 Do you think so?
Speaker CELIA
3.4.22 Yes, I think he is not a pickpurse nor a horse-stealer,
3.4.23 but for his verity in love, I do think him as
3.4.24 concave as a covered goblet or a worm-eaten nut.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.4.25 Not true in love?
Speaker CELIA
3.4.26 Yes, when he is in, but I think he is not in.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.4.27 You have heard him swear downright he
3.4.28 was.
Speaker CELIA
3.4.29 Was is not is. Besides, the oath of a lover is
3.4.30 no stronger than the word of a tapster. They are
3.4.31 both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends
3.4.32 here in the forest on the Duke your father.
Speaker ROSALIND
3.4.33 I met the Duke yesterday and had much
3.4.34 question with him. He asked me of what parentage
3.4.35 I was. I told him, of as good as he. So he laughed
3.4.36 and let me go. But what talk we of fathers when
3.4.37 there is such a man as Orlando?
Speaker CELIA
3.4.38 O, that’s a brave man. He writes brave verses,
3.4.39 speaks brave words, swears brave oaths, and breaks
3.4.40 them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of
3.4.41 his lover, as a puny tilter that spurs his horse but on
3.4.42 one side breaks his staff like a noble goose; but all’s
3.4.43 brave that youth mounts and folly guides.Enter Corin.
3.4.44 Who comes here?
Stage Directions Enter Corin.
Speaker CORIN
3.4.45 Mistress and master, you have oft inquired
3.4.46 After the shepherd that complained of love,
3.4.47 Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
3.4.48 Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
3.4.49 That was his mistress.
Speaker CELIA
Stage Directions , as Aliena
3.4.50 Well, and what of him?
Speaker CORIN
3.4.51 If you will see a pageant truly played
3.4.52 Between the pale complexion of true love
3.4.53 And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
3.4.54 Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you
3.4.55 If you will mark it.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , aside to Celia
3.4.56 O come, let us remove.
3.4.57 The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
3.4.58 As Ganymede, to Corin. Bring us to this sight, and
3.4.59 you shall say
3.4.60 I’ll prove a busy actor in their play.
Stage Directions As Ganymede, to Corin. 
Stage Directions As Ganymede,
Stage Directions to Corin.
Stage Directions They exit.Scene 3

Stage Directions Enter Silvius and Phoebe.
Speaker SILVIUS
3.5.1 Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me. Do not, Phoebe.
3.5.2 Say that you love me not, but say not so
3.5.3 In bitterness. The common executioner,
3.5.4 Whose heart th’ accustomed sight of death makes
3.5.5 hard,
3.5.6 Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
3.5.7 But first begs pardon. Will you sterner be
3.5.8 Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
Stage Directions Enter, unobserved, Rosalind as Ganymede, Celia asAliena, and Corin.
Speaker PHOEBE
3.5.9 I would not be thy executioner.
3.5.10 I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
3.5.11 Thou tell’st me there is murder in mine eye.
3.5.12 ’Tis pretty, sure, and very probable
3.5.13 That eyes, that are the frail’st and softest things,
3.5.14 Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
3.5.15 Should be called tyrants, butchers, murderers.
3.5.16 Now I do frown on thee with all my heart,
3.5.17 And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.
3.5.18 Now counterfeit to swoon;, why, now fall down;
3.5.19 Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
3.5.20 Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.
3.5.21 Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee.
3.5.22 Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
3.5.23 Some scar of it. Lean upon a rush,
3.5.24 The cicatrice and capable impressure
3.5.25 Thy palm some moment keeps. But now mine eyes,
3.5.26 Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not;
3.5.27 Nor I am sure there is no force in eyes
3.5.28 That can do hurt.
Speaker SILVIUS
3.5.29 O dear Phoebe,
3.5.30 If ever—as that ever may be near—
3.5.31 You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
3.5.32 Then shall you know the wounds invisible
3.5.33 That love’s keen arrows make.
Speaker PHOEBE
3.5.34 But till that time
3.5.35 Come not thou near me. And when that time
3.5.36 comes,
3.5.37 Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not,
3.5.38 As till that time I shall not pity thee.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede, coming forward
Stage Directions as Ganymede,
Stage Directions coming forward
3.5.39 And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,
3.5.40 That you insult, exult, and all at once,
3.5.41 Over the wretched? What though you have no
3.5.42 beauty—
3.5.43 As, by my faith, I see no more in you
3.5.44 Than without candle may go dark to bed—
3.5.45 Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
3.5.46 Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
3.5.47 I see no more in you than in the ordinary
3.5.48 Of nature’s sale-work.—’Od’s my little life,
3.5.49 I think she means to tangle my eyes, too.—
3.5.50 No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it.
3.5.51 ’Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
3.5.52 Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream
3.5.53 That can entame my spirits to your worship.—
3.5.54 You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
3.5.55 Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
3.5.56 You are a thousand times a properer man
3.5.57 Than she a woman. ’Tis such fools as you
3.5.58 That makes the world full of ill-favored children.
3.5.59 ’Tis not her glass but you that flatters her,
3.5.60 And out of you she sees herself more proper
3.5.61 Than any of her lineaments can show her.—
3.5.62 But, mistress, know yourself. Down on your knees
3.5.63 And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man’s love,
3.5.64 For I must tell you friendly in your ear,
3.5.65 Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.
3.5.66 Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer.
3.5.67 Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.—
3.5.68 So take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.
Speaker PHOEBE
3.5.69 Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together.
3.5.70 I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions ,as Ganymede
3.5.71 He’s fall’n in love with your
3.5.72 foulness. (To Silvius.) And she’ll fall in love with
3.5.73 my anger. If it be so, as fast as she answers thee with
3.5.74 frowning looks, I’ll sauce her with bitter words. (ToPhoebe.) 
3.5.75 Why look you so upon me?
Stage Directions  (To Silvius.)
Stage Directions  (ToPhoebe.) 
Speaker PHOEBE
3.5.76 For no ill will I bear you.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
3.5.77 I pray you, do not fall in love with me,
3.5.78 For I am falser than vows made in wine.
3.5.79 Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
3.5.80 ’Tis at the tuft of olives, here hard by.—
3.5.81 Will you go, sister?—Shepherd, ply her hard.—
3.5.82 Come, sister.—Shepherdess, look on him better,
3.5.83 And be not proud. Though all the world could see,
3.5.84 None could be so abused in sight as he.—
3.5.85 Come, to our flock.
Stage Directions She exits, with Celia and Corin.
Speaker PHOEBE
Stage Directions , aside
3.5.86 Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:
3.5.87 Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?
Speaker SILVIUS
3.5.88 Sweet Phoebe—
Speaker PHOEBE
3.5.89 Ha, what sayst thou, Silvius?
Speaker SILVIUS
3.5.90 Sweet Phoebe, pity me.
Speaker PHOEBE
3.5.91 Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
Speaker SILVIUS
3.5.92 Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.
3.5.93 If you do sorrow at my grief in love,
3.5.94 By giving love your sorrow and my grief
3.5.95 Were both extermined.
Speaker PHOEBE
3.5.96 Thou hast my love. Is not that neighborly?
Speaker SILVIUS
3.5.97 I would have you.
Speaker PHOEBE
3.5.98 Why, that were covetousness.
3.5.99 Silvius, the time was that I hated thee;
3.5.100 And yet it is not that I bear thee love;,
3.5.101 But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
3.5.102 Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
3.5.103 I will endure, and I’ll employ thee too.
3.5.104 But do not look for further recompense
3.5.105 Than thine own gladness that thou art employed.
Speaker SILVIUS
3.5.106 So holy and so perfect is my love,
3.5.107 And I in such a poverty of grace,
3.5.108 That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
3.5.109 To glean the broken ears after the man
3.5.110 That the main harvest reaps. Loose now and then
3.5.111 A scattered smile, and that I’ll live upon.
Speaker PHOEBE
3.5.112 Know’st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
Speaker SILVIUS
3.5.113 Not very well, but I have met him oft,
3.5.114 And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
3.5.115 That the old carlot once was master of.
Speaker PHOEBE
3.5.116 Think not I love him, though I ask for him.
3.5.117 ’Tis but a peevish boy—yet he talks well—
3.5.118 But what care I for words? Yet words do well
3.5.119 When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
3.5.120 It is a pretty youth—not very pretty—
3.5.121 But sure he’s proud—and yet his pride becomes
3.5.122 him.
3.5.123 He’ll make a proper man. The best thing in him
3.5.124 Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
3.5.125 Did make offense, his eye did heal it up.
3.5.126 He is not very tall—yet for his years he’s tall.
3.5.127 His leg is but so-so—and yet ’tis well.
3.5.128 There was a pretty redness in his lip,
3.5.129 A little riper and more lusty red
3.5.130 Than that mixed in his cheek: ’twas just the
3.5.131 difference
3.5.132 Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.
3.5.133 There be some women, Silvius, had they marked
3.5.134 him
3.5.135 In parcels as I did, would have gone near
3.5.136 To fall in love with him; but for my part
3.5.137 I love him not nor hate him not; and yet
3.5.138 I have more cause to hate him than to love him.
3.5.139 For what had he to do to chide at me?
3.5.140 He said mine eyes were black and my hair black,
3.5.141 And now I am remembered, scorned at me.
3.5.142 I marvel why I answered not again.
3.5.143 But that’s all one: omittance is no quittance.
3.5.144 I’ll write to him a very taunting letter,
3.5.145 And thou shalt bear it. Wilt thou, Silvius?
Speaker SILVIUS
3.5.146 Phoebe, with all my heart.
Speaker PHOEBE
3.5.147 I’ll write it straight.
3.5.148 The matter’s in my head and in my heart.
3.5.149 I will be bitter with him and passing short.
3.5.150 Go with me, Silvius.
Stage Directions They exit.Act 4
Scene 4

Stage Directions Enter Rosalind as Ganymede, and Celia as Aliena,and Jaques.
Speaker JAQUES
4.1.1 I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better
4.1.2 acquainted with thee.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.3 They say you are a melancholy
4.1.4 fellow.
Speaker JAQUES
4.1.5 I am so. I do love it better than laughing.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.6 Those that are in extremity
4.1.7 of either are abominable fellows and betray
4.1.8 themselves to every modern censure worse than
4.1.9 drunkards.
Speaker JAQUES
4.1.10 Why, ’tis good to be sad and say nothing.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.11 Why then, ’tis good to be a
4.1.12 post.
Speaker JAQUES
4.1.13 I have neither the scholar’s melancholy, which
4.1.14 is emulation; nor the musician’s, which is fantastical;
4.1.15 nor the courtier’s, which is proud; nor the
4.1.16 soldier’s, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer’s,
4.1.17 which is politic; nor the lady’s, which is nice; nor
4.1.18 the lover’s, which is all these; but it is a melancholy
4.1.19 of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted
4.1.20 from many objects, and indeed the sundry
4.1.21 contemplation of my travels, in which my often
4.1.22 rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.23 A traveller. By my faith, you
4.1.24 have great reason to be sad. I fear you have sold
4.1.25 your own lands to see other men’s. Then to have
4.1.26 seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes
4.1.27 and poor hands.
Speaker JAQUES
4.1.28 Yes, I have gained my experience.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.29 And your experience makes
4.1.30 you sad. I had rather have a fool to make me merry
4.1.31 than experience to make me sad—and to travel for
4.1.32 it too.
Stage Directions Enter Orlando.
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.33 Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind.
Speaker JAQUES
4.1.34 Nay then, God be wi’ you, an you talk in blank
4.1.35 verse.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.36 Farewell, Monsieur Traveller.
4.1.37 Look you lisp and wear strange suits, disable all
4.1.38 the benefits of your own country, be out of love with
4.1.39 your nativity, and almost chide God for making you
4.1.40 that countenance you are, or I will scarce think you
4.1.41 have swam in a gondola.Jaques exits.
4.1.42 Why, how now, Orlando, where have you been all
4.1.43 this while? You a lover? An you serve me such
4.1.44 another trick, never come in my sight more.
Stage Directions Jaques exits.
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.45 My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of
4.1.46 my promise.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.47 Break an hour’s promise in
4.1.48 love? He that will divide a minute into a thousand
4.1.49 parts and break but a part of the thousand part of a
4.1.50 minute in the affairs of love, it may be said of him
4.1.51 that Cupid hath clapped him o’ th’ shoulder, but I’ll
4.1.52 warrant him heart-whole.
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.53 Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.54 Nay, an you be so tardy,
4.1.55 come no more in my sight. I had as lief be wooed of
4.1.56 a snail.
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.57 Of a snail?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.58 Ay, of a snail, for though he
4.1.59 comes slowly, he carries his house on his head—a
4.1.60 better jointure, I think, than you make a woman.
4.1.61 Besides, he brings his destiny with him.
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.62 What’s that?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.63 Why, horns, which such as
4.1.64 you are fain to be beholding to your wives for. But
4.1.65 he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the
4.1.66 slander of his wife.
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.67 Virtue is no hornmaker, and my Rosalind is
4.1.68 virtuous.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.69 And I am your Rosalind.
Speaker CELIA
Stage Directions , as Aliena
4.1.70 It pleases him to call you so, but he
4.1.71 hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede, to Orlando
Stage Directions as Ganymede
Stage Directions to Orlando
4.1.72 Come, woo me,
4.1.73 woo me, for now I am in a holiday humor, and like
4.1.74 enough to consent. What would you say to me now
4.1.75 an I were your very, very Rosalind?
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.76 I would kiss before I spoke.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.77 Nay, you were better speak
4.1.78 first, and when you were gravelled for lack of
4.1.79 matter, you might take occasion to kiss. Very good
4.1.80 orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for
4.1.81 lovers lacking—God warn us—matter, the cleanliest
4.1.82 shift is to kiss.
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.83 How if the kiss be denied?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.84 Then she puts you to entreaty,
4.1.85 and there begins new matter.
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.86 Who could be out, being before his beloved
4.1.87 mistress?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.88 Marry, that should you if I
4.1.89 were your mistress, or I should think my honesty
4.1.90 ranker than my wit.
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.91 What, of my suit?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.92 Not out of your apparel, and
4.1.93 yet out of your suit. Am not I your Rosalind?
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.94 I take some joy to say you are because I
4.1.95 would be talking of her.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.96 Well, in her person I say I
4.1.97 will not have you.
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.98 Then, in mine own person I die.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.99 No, faith, die by attorney.
4.1.100 The poor world is almost six thousand years old,
4.1.101 and in all this time there was not any man died in
4.1.102 his own person, videlicet, in a love cause. Troilus
4.1.103 had his brains dashed out with a Grecian club, yet
4.1.104 he did what he could to die before, and he is one of
4.1.105 the patterns of love. Leander, he would have lived
4.1.106 many a fair year though Hero had turned nun, if it
4.1.107 had not been for a hot midsummer night, for, good
4.1.108 youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont
4.1.109 and, being taken with the cramp, was
4.1.110 drowned; and the foolish chroniclers of that age
4.1.111 found it was Hero of Sestos. But these are all lies.
4.1.112 Men have died from time to time, and worms have
4.1.113 eaten them, but not for love.
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.114 I would not have my right Rosalind of this
4.1.115 mind, for I protest her frown might kill me.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.116 By this hand, it will not kill a
4.1.117 fly. But come; now I will be your Rosalind in a more
4.1.118 coming-on disposition, and ask me what you will, I
4.1.119 will grant it.
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.120 Then love me, Rosalind.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.121 Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and
4.1.122 Saturdays and all.
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.123 And wilt thou have me?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.124 Ay, and twenty such.
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.125 What sayest thou?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.126 Are you not good?
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.127 I hope so.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.128 Why then, can one desire
4.1.129 too much of a good thing?—Come, sister, you shall
4.1.130 be the priest and marry us.—Give me your hand,
4.1.131 Orlando.—What do you say, sister?
Speaker ORLANDO
Stage Directions , to Celia
4.1.132 Pray thee marry us.
Speaker CELIA
Stage Directions , as Aliena
4.1.133 I cannot say the words.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.134 You must begin Will you,Orlando—
Speaker CELIA
Stage Directions , as Aliena
4.1.136 Go to.—Will you, Orlando, have to
4.1.137 wife this Rosalind?
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.138 I will.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.139 Ay, but when?
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.140 Why now, as fast as she can marry us.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.141 Then you must say I takethee, Rosalind, for wife.
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.143 I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.144 I might ask you for your
4.1.145 commission, but I do take thee, Orlando, for my
4.1.146 husband. There’s a girl goes before the priest, and
4.1.147 certainly a woman’s thought runs before her
4.1.148 actions.
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.149 So do all thoughts. They are winged.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.150 Now tell me how long you
4.1.151 would have her after you have possessed her?
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.152 Forever and a day.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.153 Say a day without the
4.1.154 ever. No, no, Orlando, men are April when they
4.1.155 woo, December when they wed. Maids are May
4.1.156 when they are maids, but the sky changes when
4.1.157 they are wives. I will be more jealous of thee than a
4.1.158 Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen, more clamorous
4.1.159 than a parrot against rain, more newfangled than
4.1.160 an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I
4.1.161 will weep for nothing, like Diana in the fountain,
4.1.162 and I will do that when you are disposed to be
4.1.163 merry. I will laugh like a hyena, and that when thou
4.1.164 art inclined to sleep.
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.165 But will my Rosalind do so?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.166 By my life, she will do as I
4.1.167 do.
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.168 O, but she is wise.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.169 Or else she could not have
4.1.170 the wit to do this. The wiser, the waywarder. Make
4.1.171 the doors upon a woman’s wit, and it will out at the
4.1.172 casement. Shut that, and ’twill out at the keyhole.
4.1.173 Stop that, ’twill fly with the smoke out at the
4.1.174 chimney.
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.175 A man that had a wife with such a wit, he
4.1.176 might say Wit, whither wilt?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.177 Nay, you might keep that
4.1.178 check for it till you met your wife’s wit going to
4.1.179 your neighbor’s bed.
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.180 And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.181 Marry, to say she came to
4.1.182 seek you there. You shall never take her without her
4.1.183 answer unless you take her without her tongue. O,
4.1.184 that woman that cannot make her fault her husband’s
4.1.185 occasion, let her never nurse her child
4.1.186 herself, for she will breed it like a fool.
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.187 For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave
4.1.188 thee.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.189 Alas, dear love, I cannot lack
4.1.190 thee two hours.
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.191 I must attend the Duke at dinner. By two
4.1.192 o’clock I will be with thee again.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.193 Ay, go your ways, go your
4.1.194 ways. I knew what you would prove. My friends told
4.1.195 me as much, and I thought no less. That flattering
4.1.196 tongue of yours won me. ’Tis but one cast away, and
4.1.197 so, come, death. Two o’clock is your hour?
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.198 Ay, sweet Rosalind.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.199 By my troth, and in good
4.1.200 earnest, and so God mend me, and by all pretty
4.1.201 oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot of
4.1.202 your promise or come one minute behind your
4.1.203 hour, I will think you the most pathetical break-promise,
4.1.204 and the most hollow lover, and the most
4.1.205 unworthy of her you call Rosalind that may be
4.1.206 chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful.
4.1.207 Therefore beware my censure, and keep your
4.1.208 promise.
Speaker ORLANDO
4.1.209 With no less religion than if thou wert indeed
4.1.210 my Rosalind. So, adieu.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.1.211 Well, time is the old justice
4.1.212 that examines all such offenders, and let time try.
4.1.213 Adieu.
Stage Directions Orlando exits.
Speaker CELIA
4.1.214 You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate.
4.1.215 We must have your doublet and hose plucked
4.1.216 over your head and show the world what the bird
4.1.217 hath done to her own nest.
Speaker ROSALIND
4.1.218 O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou
4.1.219 didst know how many fathom deep I am in love. But
4.1.220 it cannot be sounded; my affection hath an
4.1.221 unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal.
Speaker CELIA
4.1.222 Or rather bottomless, that as fast as you pour
4.1.223 affection in, it runs out.
Speaker ROSALIND
4.1.224 No, that same wicked bastard of Venus, that
4.1.225 was begot of thought, conceived of spleen, and born
4.1.226 of madness, that blind rascally boy that abuses
4.1.227 everyone’s eyes because his own are out, let him be
4.1.228 judge how deep I am in love. I’ll tell thee, Aliena, I
4.1.229 cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I’ll go find a
4.1.230 shadow and sigh till he come.
Speaker CELIA
4.1.231 And I’ll sleep.
Stage Directions They exit.Scene 4

Stage Directions Enter Jaques and Lords, like foresters.
Speaker JAQUES
4.2.1 Which is he that killed the deer?
Speaker FIRST LORD
4.2.2 Sir, it was I.
Speaker JAQUES
Stage Directions , to the other Lords
4.2.3 Let’s present him to the
4.2.4 Duke like a Roman conqueror. And it would do well
4.2.5 to set the deer’s horns upon his head for a branch of
4.2.6 victory.—Have you no song, forester, for this
4.2.7 purpose?
Speaker SECOND LORD
4.2.8 Yes, sir.
Speaker JAQUES
4.2.9 Sing it. ’Tis no matter how it be in tune, so it
4.2.10 make noise enough.
Speaker SECOND LORD
Stage Directions  singsWhat shall he have that killed the deer?His leather skin and horns to wear.Then sing him home.
Stage Directions (The rest shall bear this burden:)Take thou no scorn to wear the horn.It was a crest ere thou wast born.Thy father’s father wore it,And thy father bore it.The horn, the horn, the lusty hornIs not a thing to laugh to scorn.
Stage Directions They exit.Scene 4

Stage Directions Enter Rosalind dressed as Ganymede and Celiadressed as Aliena.
Speaker ROSALIND
4.3.1 How say you now? Is it not past two o’clock?
4.3.2 And here much Orlando.
Speaker CELIA
4.3.3 I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain
4.3.4 he hath ta’en his bow and arrows and is gone forth
4.3.5 to sleep.Enter Silvius.
4.3.6 Look who comes here.
Stage Directions Enter Silvius.
Speaker SILVIUS
Stage Directions , to Rosalind
4.3.7 My errand is to you, fair youth.
4.3.8 My gentle Phoebe did bid me give you this.He gives Rosalind a paper.
4.3.9 I know not the contents, but as I guess
4.3.10 By the stern brow and waspish action
4.3.11 Which she did use as she was writing of it,
4.3.12 It bears an angry tenor. Pardon me.
4.3.13 I am but as a guiltless messenger.
Stage Directions He gives Rosalind a paper.
Stage Directions Rosalind reads the letter.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.3.14 Patience herself would startle at this letter
4.3.15 And play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all.
4.3.16 She says I am not fair, that I lack manners.
4.3.17 She calls me proud, and that she could not love me
4.3.18 Were man as rare as phoenix. ’Od’s my will,
4.3.19 Her love is not the hare that I do hunt.
4.3.20 Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
4.3.21 This is a letter of your own device.
Speaker SILVIUS
4.3.22 No, I protest. I know not the contents.
4.3.23 Phoebe did write it.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.3.24 Come, come, you are a
4.3.25 fool,
4.3.26 And turned into the extremity of love.
4.3.27 I saw her hand. She has a leathern hand,
4.3.28 A freestone-colored hand. I verily did think
4.3.29 That her old gloves were on, but ’twas her hands.
4.3.30 She has a huswife’s hand—but that’s no matter.
4.3.31 I say she never did invent this letter.
4.3.32 This is a man’s invention, and his hand.
Speaker SILVIUS
4.3.33 Sure it is hers.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.3.34 Why, ’tis a boisterous and a cruel style,
4.3.35 A style for challengers. Why, she defies me
4.3.36 Like Turk to Christian. Women’s gentle brain
4.3.37 Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention,
4.3.38 Such Ethiop words, blacker in their effect
4.3.39 Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?
Speaker SILVIUS
4.3.40 So please you, for I never heard it yet,
4.3.41 Yet heard too much of Phoebe’s cruelty.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.3.42 She Phoebes me. Mark how the tyrant writes.(Read.)Art thou god to shepherd turned,That a maiden’s heart hath burned?
4.3.45 Can a woman rail thus?
Stage Directions (Read.)
Speaker SILVIUS
4.3.46 Call you this railing?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede(Read.)Why, thy godhead laid apart,Warr’st thou with a woman’s heart?
4.3.49 Did you ever hear such railing?Whiles the eye of man did woo me,That could do no vengeance to me.
4.3.52 Meaning me a beast.If the scorn of your bright eyneHave power to raise such love in mine,Alack, in me what strange effectWould they work in mild aspect?Whiles you chid me, I did love.How then might your prayers move?He that brings this love to theeLittle knows this love in me,And by him seal up thy mindWhether that thy youth and kindWill the faithful offer takeOf me, and all that I can make,Or else by him my love deny,And then I’ll study how to die.
Stage Directions (Read.)
Speaker SILVIUS
4.3.67 Call you this chiding?
Speaker CELIA
Stage Directions , as Aliena
4.3.68 Alas, poor shepherd.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.3.69 Do you pity him? No, he
4.3.70 deserves no pity.—Wilt thou love such a woman?
4.3.71 What, to make thee an instrument and play false
4.3.72 strains upon thee? Not to be endured. Well, go your
4.3.73 way to her, for I see love hath made thee a tame
4.3.74 snake, and say this to her: that if she love me, I
4.3.75 charge her to love thee; if she will not, I will never
4.3.76 have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a true
4.3.77 lover, hence, and not a word, for here comes more
4.3.78 company.
Stage Directions Silvius exits.
Stage Directions Enter Oliver.
Speaker OLIVER
4.3.79 Good morrow, fair ones. Pray you, if you know,
4.3.80 Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
4.3.81 A sheepcote fenced about with olive trees?
Speaker CELIA
Stage Directions , as Aliena
4.3.82 West of this place, down in the neighbor bottom;
4.3.83 The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
4.3.84 Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
4.3.85 But at this hour the house doth keep itself.
4.3.86 There’s none within.
Speaker OLIVER
4.3.87 If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
4.3.88 Then should I know you by description—
4.3.89 Such garments, and such years. The boy is fair,Of female favor, and bestows himselfLike a ripe sister; the woman lowAnd browner than her brother. Are not you
4.3.93 The owner of the house I did inquire for?
Speaker CELIA
Stage Directions , as Aliena
4.3.94 It is no boast, being asked, to say we are.
Speaker OLIVER
4.3.95 Orlando doth commend him to you both,
4.3.96 And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
4.3.97 He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?
Stage Directions He shows a stained handkerchief.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.3.98 I am. What must we understand by this?
Speaker OLIVER
4.3.99 Some of my shame, if you will know of me
4.3.100 What man I am, and how, and why, and where
4.3.101 This handkercher was stained.
Speaker CELIA
Stage Directions , as Aliena
4.3.102 I pray you tell it.
Speaker OLIVER
4.3.103 When last the young Orlando parted from you,
4.3.104 He left a promise to return again
4.3.105 Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,
4.3.106 Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
4.3.107 Lo, what befell. He threw his eye aside—
4.3.108 And mark what object did present itself:
4.3.109 Under an old oak, whose boughs were mossed with
4.3.110 age
4.3.111 And high top bald with dry antiquity,
4.3.112 A wretched, ragged man, o’ergrown with hair,
4.3.113 Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck
4.3.114 A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,
4.3.115 Who with her head, nimble in threats, approached
4.3.116 The opening of his mouth. But suddenly,
4.3.117 Seeing Orlando, it unlinked itself
4.3.118 And, with indented glides, did slip away
4.3.119 Into a bush, under which bush’s shade
4.3.120 A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
4.3.121 Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch
4.3.122 When that the sleeping man should stir—for ’tis
4.3.123 The royal disposition of that beast
4.3.124 To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.
4.3.125 This seen, Orlando did approach the man
4.3.126 And found it was his brother, his elder brother.
Speaker CELIA
Stage Directions , as Aliena
4.3.127 O, I have heard him speak of that same brother,
4.3.128 And he did render him the most unnatural
4.3.129 That lived amongst men.
Speaker OLIVER
4.3.130 And well he might so do,
4.3.131 For well I know he was unnatural.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.3.132 But to Orlando: did he leave him there,
4.3.133 Food to the sucked and hungry lioness?
Speaker OLIVER
4.3.134 Twice did he turn his back and purposed so,
4.3.135 But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
4.3.136 And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
4.3.137 Made him give battle to the lioness,
4.3.138 Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling,
4.3.139 From miserable slumber I awaked.
Speaker CELIA
Stage Directions , as Aliena
4.3.140 Are you his brother?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.3.141 Was ’t you he rescued?
Speaker CELIA
Stage Directions , as Aliena
4.3.142 Was ’t you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
Speaker OLIVER
4.3.143 ’Twas I, but ’tis not I. I do not shame
4.3.144 To tell you what I was, since my conversion
4.3.145 So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.3.146 But for the bloody napkin?
Speaker OLIVER
4.3.147 By and by.
4.3.148 When from the first to last betwixt us two
4.3.149 Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed—
4.3.150 As how I came into that desert place—
4.3.151 In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,
4.3.152 Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
4.3.153 Committing me unto my brother’s love;
4.3.154 Who led me instantly unto his cave,
4.3.155 There stripped himself, and here upon his arm
4.3.156 The lioness had torn some flesh away,
4.3.157 Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,
4.3.158 And cried in fainting upon Rosalind.
4.3.159 Brief, I recovered him, bound up his wound,
4.3.160 And after some small space, being strong at heart,
4.3.161 He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
4.3.162 To tell this story, that you might excuse
4.3.163 His broken promise, and to give this napkin
4.3.164 Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth

Stage Directions Rosalind faints.
Speaker CELIA
Stage Directions , as Aliena
4.3.166 Why, how now, Ganymede, sweet Ganymede?
Speaker OLIVER
4.3.167 Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
Speaker CELIA
Stage Directions , as Aliena
4.3.168 There is more in it.—Cousin Ganymede.
Speaker OLIVER
4.3.169 Look, he recovers.
Speaker ROSALIND
4.3.170 I would I were at home.
Speaker CELIA
Stage Directions , as Aliena
4.3.171 We’ll lead you thither.—I pray you,
4.3.172 will you take him by the arm?
Speaker OLIVER
Stage Directions , helping Rosalind to rise
4.3.173 Be of good cheer,
4.3.174 youth. You a man? You lack a man’s heart.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.3.175 I do so, I confess it. Ah,
4.3.176 sirrah, a body would think this was well-counterfeited.
4.3.177 I pray you tell your brother how well I
4.3.178 counterfeited. Heigh-ho.
Speaker OLIVER
4.3.179 This was not counterfeit. There is too great
4.3.180 testimony in your complexion that it was a passion
4.3.181 of earnest.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.3.182 Counterfeit, I assure you.
Speaker OLIVER
4.3.183 Well then, take a good heart, and counterfeit to
4.3.184 be a man.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.3.185 So I do; but, i’ faith, I should
4.3.186 have been a woman by right.
Speaker CELIA
Stage Directions , as Aliena
4.3.187 Come, you look paler and paler. Pray
4.3.188 you draw homewards.—Good sir, go with us.
Speaker OLIVER
4.3.189 That will I, for I must bear answer back
4.3.190 How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
4.3.191 I shall devise something.
4.3.192 But I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him.
4.3.193 Will you go?

Scene 5

Stage Directions Enter Touchstone and Audrey.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
5.1.1 We shall find a time, Audrey. Patience,
5.1.2 gentle Audrey.
Speaker AUDREY
5.1.3 Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the
5.1.4 old gentleman’s saying.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
5.1.5 A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most
5.1.6 vile Martext. But Audrey, there is a youth here in
5.1.7 the forest lays claim to you.
Speaker AUDREY
5.1.8 Ay, I know who ’tis. He hath no interest in me
5.1.9 in the world.Enter William.
5.1.10 Here comes the man you mean.
Stage Directions Enter William.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
5.1.11 It is meat and drink to me to see a clown.
5.1.12 By my troth, we that have good wits have much to
5.1.13 answer for. We shall be flouting. We cannot hold.
Speaker WILLIAM
5.1.14 Good ev’n, Audrey.
Speaker AUDREY
5.1.15 God gi’ good ev’n, William.
Speaker WILLIAM
Stage Directions , to Touchstone
5.1.16 And good ev’n to you, sir.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
5.1.17 Good ev’n, gentle friend. Cover thy head,
5.1.18 cover thy head. Nay, prithee, be covered. How old
5.1.19 are you, friend?
Speaker WILLIAM
5.1.20 Five-and-twenty, sir.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
5.1.21 A ripe age. Is thy name William?
Speaker WILLIAM
5.1.22 William, sir.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
5.1.23 A fair name. Wast born i’ th’ forest here?
Speaker WILLIAM
5.1.24 Ay, sir, I thank God.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
5.1.25 Thank God. A good answer. Art rich?
Speaker WILLIAM
5.1.26 ’Faith sir, so-so.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
5.1.27 So-so is good, very good, very excellent
5.1.28 good. And yet it is not: it is but so-so. Art thou wise?
Speaker WILLIAM
5.1.29 Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
5.1.30 Why, thou sayst well. I do now remember
5.1.31 a saying: The fool doth think he is wise, but thewise man knows himself to be a fool. The heathen
5.1.33 philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,
5.1.34 would open his lips when he put it into his mouth,
5.1.35 meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and
5.1.36 lips to open. You do love this maid?
Speaker WILLIAM
5.1.37 I do, sir.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
5.1.38 Give me your hand. Art thou learned?
Speaker WILLIAM
5.1.39 No, sir.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
5.1.40 Then learn this of me: to have is to have.
5.1.41 For it is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured
5.1.42 out of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth
5.1.43 empty the other. For all your writers do consent
5.1.44 that ipse is he. Now, you are not ipse, for I am he.
Speaker WILLIAM
5.1.45 Which he, sir?
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
5.1.46 He, sir, that must marry this woman.
5.1.47 Therefore, you clown, abandon—which is in the
5.1.48 vulgar leave—the society—which in the boorish
5.1.49 is company—of this female—which in the common
5.1.50 is woman; which together is, abandon the
5.1.51 society of this female, or, clown, thou perishest; or,
5.1.52 to thy better understanding, diest; or, to wit, I kill
5.1.53 thee, make thee away, translate thy life into death,
5.1.54 thy liberty into bondage. I will deal in poison with
5.1.55 thee, or in bastinado, or in steel. I will bandy with
5.1.56 thee in faction. I will o’errun thee with policy. I
5.1.57 will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways. Therefore
5.1.58 tremble and depart.
Speaker AUDREY
5.1.59 Do, good William.
Speaker WILLIAM
Stage Directions , to Touchstone
5.1.60 God rest you merry, sir.
Stage Directions He exits.
Stage Directions Enter Corin.
Speaker CORIN
5.1.61 Our master and mistress seeks you. Come away,

Speaker TOUCHSTONE
5.1.63 Trip, Audrey, trip, Audrey.—I attend, I
5.1.64 attend.
Stage Directions They exit.Scene 5

Stage Directions Enter Orlando, with his arm in a sling, and Oliver.
Speaker ORLANDO
5.2.1 Is ’t possible that on so little acquaintance
5.2.2 you should like her? That, but seeing, you should
5.2.3 love her? And loving, woo? And wooing, she should
5.2.4 grant? And will you persever to enjoy her?
Speaker OLIVER
5.2.5 Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the
5.2.6 poverty of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden
5.2.7 wooing, nor her sudden consenting, but say with
5.2.8 me I love Aliena; say with her that she loves me;
5.2.9 consent with both that we may enjoy each other. It
5.2.10 shall be to your good, for my father’s house and all
5.2.11 the revenue that was old Sir Rowland’s will I estate
5.2.12 upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.
Stage Directions Enter Rosalind, as Ganymede.
Speaker ORLANDO
5.2.13 You have my consent. Let your wedding be
5.2.14 tomorrow. Thither will I invite the Duke and all ’s
5.2.15 contented followers. Go you and prepare Aliena,

5.2.17 God save you,
5.2.18 brother.
Speaker OLIVER
5.2.19 And you, fair sister.He exits.
Stage Directions He exits.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
5.2.20 O my dear Orlando, how it
5.2.21 grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf.
Speaker ORLANDO
5.2.22 It is my arm.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
5.2.23 I thought thy heart had been
5.2.24 wounded with the claws of a lion.
Speaker ORLANDO
5.2.25 Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
5.2.26 Did your brother tell you
5.2.27 how I counterfeited to swoon when he showed me
5.2.28 your handkercher?
Speaker ORLANDO
5.2.29 Ay, and greater wonders than that.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
5.2.30 O, I know where you are.
5.2.31 Nay, ’tis true. There was never anything so sudden
5.2.32 but the fight of two rams, and Caesar’s thrasonical
5.2.33 brag of I came, saw, and overcame. For your
5.2.34 brother and my sister no sooner met but they
5.2.35 looked, no sooner looked but they loved, no sooner
5.2.36 loved but they sighed, no sooner sighed but they
5.2.37 asked one another the reason, no sooner knew the
5.2.38 reason but they sought the remedy; and in these
5.2.39 degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage,
5.2.40 which they will climb incontinent, or else be incontinent
5.2.41 before marriage. They are in the very wrath
5.2.42 of love, and they will together. Clubs cannot part
5.2.43 them.
Speaker ORLANDO
5.2.44 They shall be married tomorrow, and I will
5.2.45 bid the Duke to the nuptial. But O, how bitter a
5.2.46 thing it is to look into happiness through another
5.2.47 man’s eyes. By so much the more shall I tomorrow
5.2.48 be at the height of heart-heaviness by how much I
5.2.49 shall think my brother happy in having what he
5.2.50 wishes for.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
5.2.51 Why, then, tomorrow I cannot
5.2.52 serve your turn for Rosalind?
Speaker ORLANDO
5.2.53 I can live no longer by thinking.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
5.2.54 I will weary you then no
5.2.55 longer with idle talking. Know of me then—for
5.2.56 now I speak to some purpose—that I know you are
5.2.57 a gentleman of good conceit. I speak not this that
5.2.58 you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge,
5.2.59 insomuch I say I know you are. Neither do I labor
5.2.60 for a greater esteem than may in some little measure
5.2.61 draw a belief from you to do yourself good, and
5.2.62 not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I
5.2.63 can do strange things. I have, since I was three year
5.2.64 old, conversed with a magician, most profound in
5.2.65 his art and yet not damnable. If you do love Rosalind
5.2.66 so near the heart as your gesture cries it out,
5.2.67 when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry
5.2.68 her. I know into what straits of fortune she is
5.2.69 driven, and it is not impossible to me, if it appear
5.2.70 not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes
5.2.71 tomorrow, human as she is, and without any
5.2.72 danger.
Speaker ORLANDO
5.2.73 Speak’st thou in sober meanings?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
5.2.74 By my life I do, which I
5.2.75 tender dearly, though I say I am a magician. Therefore
5.2.76 put you in your best array, bid your friends; for
5.2.77 if you will be married tomorrow, you shall, and to
5.2.78 Rosalind, if you will.Enter Silvius and Phoebe.
5.2.79 Look, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of
5.2.80 hers.
Stage Directions Enter Silvius and Phoebe.
Speaker PHOEBE
Stage Directions , to Rosalind
5.2.81 Youth, you have done me much ungentleness
5.2.82 To show the letter that I writ to you.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
5.2.83 I care not if I have. It is my study
5.2.84 To seem despiteful and ungentle to you.
5.2.85 You are there followed by a faithful shepherd.
5.2.86 Look upon him, love him; he worships you.
Speaker PHOEBE
Stage Directions , to Silvius
5.2.87 Good shepherd, tell this youth what ’tis to love.

Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede

5.2.108 If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
Speaker SILVIUS
5.2.109 If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
Speaker ORLANDO
5.2.110 If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
5.2.111 Why do you speak too,
5.2.112 Why blame you me to love you?
Speaker ORLANDO
5.2.113 To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
5.2.114 Pray you, no more of this.
5.2.115 ’Tis like the howling of Irish wolves against the
5.2.116 moon. (To Silvius.) I will help you if I can. (ToPhoebe.) 
5.2.117 I would love you if I could.—Tomorrow
5.2.118 meet me all together. (To Phoebe.) I will marry
5.2.119 you if ever I marry woman, and I’ll be married
5.2.120 tomorrow. (To Orlando.) I will satisfy you if ever I
5.2.121 satisfy man, and you shall be married tomorrow.
5.2.122 (To Silvius.) I will content you, if what pleases you
5.2.123 contents you, and you shall be married tomorrow.
5.2.124 (To Orlando.) As you love Rosalind, meet. (ToSilvius.)

5.3.8 By my troth, well met. Come, sit, sit, and

5.3.10 We are for you. Sit i’ th’ middle.
Stage Directions They sit.
Speaker FIRST PAGE
5.3.11 Shall we clap into ’t roundly, without
5.3.12 hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse, which
5.3.13 are the only prologues to a bad voice?
Speaker SECOND PAGE
5.3.14 I’ faith, i’ faith, and both in a tune like
5.3.15 two gypsies on a horse.

Speaker TOUCHSTONE
5.3.40 Truly, young gentlemen, though there
5.3.41 was no great matter in the ditty, yet the note was
5.3.42 very untunable.
Speaker FIRST PAGE
5.3.43 You are deceived, sir. We kept time. We lost
5.3.44 not our time.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
5.3.45 By my troth, yes. I count it but time lost
5.3.46 to hear such a foolish song. God be wi’ you, and
5.3.47 God mend your voices.—Come, Audrey.
Stage Directions They rise and exit.Scene 5

Stage Directions Enter Duke Senior, Amiens, Jaques, Orlando, Oliver,and Celia as Aliena.
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
5.4.1 Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
5.4.2 Can do all this that he hath promisèd?
Speaker ORLANDO
5.4.3 I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not,
5.4.4 As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.
Stage Directions Enter Rosalind as Ganymede, Silvius, and Phoebe.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede
5.4.5 Patience once more whiles our compact is urged.
5.4.6 To Duke. You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,
5.4.7 You will bestow her on Orlando here?
Stage Directions To Duke. 
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
5.4.8 That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
Speaker ROSALIND
Stage Directions , as Ganymede, to Orlando
Stage Directions as Ganymede
Stage Directions to Orlando
5.4.9 And you say you will have her when I bring her?

Stage Directions as Ganymede

5.4.11 You say you’ll marry me if I be willing?
Speaker PHOEBE
5.4.12 That will I, should I die the hour after.

5.4.26 To make these doubts all even.
Stage Directions Rosalind and Celia exit.
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
5.4.27 I do remember in this shepherd boy
5.4.28 Some lively touches of my daughter’s favor.
Speaker ORLANDO
5.4.29 My lord, the first time that I ever saw him
5.4.30 Methought he was a brother to your daughter.
5.4.31 But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born
5.4.32 And hath been tutored in the rudiments
5.4.33 Of many desperate studies by his uncle,
5.4.34 Whom he reports to be a great magician
5.4.35 Obscurèd in the circle of this forest.
Stage Directions Enter Touchstone and Audrey.
Speaker JAQUES
5.4.36 There is sure another flood toward, and these
5.4.37 couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of
5.4.38 very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called
5.4.39 fools.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
5.4.40 Salutation and greeting to you all.
Speaker JAQUES
Stage Directions , to Duke
5.4.41 Good my lord, bid him welcome.
5.4.42 This is the motley-minded gentleman that I have so
5.4.43 often met in the forest. He hath been a courtier, he
5.4.44 swears.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
5.4.45 If any man doubt that, let him put me to
5.4.46 my purgation. I have trod a measure. I have flattered
5.4.47 a lady. I have been politic with my friend,
5.4.48 smooth with mine enemy. I have undone three
5.4.49 tailors. I have had four quarrels, and like to have
5.4.50 fought one.
Speaker JAQUES
5.4.51 And how was that ta’en up?
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
5.4.52 Faith, we met and found the quarrel was
5.4.53 upon the seventh cause.
Speaker JAQUES
5.4.54 How seventh cause?—Good my lord, like
5.4.55 this fellow.
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
5.4.56 I like him very well.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
5.4.57 God ’ild you, sir. I desire you of the like. I
5.4.58 press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country
5.4.59 copulatives, to swear and to forswear, according as
5.4.60 marriage binds and blood breaks. A poor virgin, sir,
5.4.61 an ill-favored thing, sir, but mine own. A poor
5.4.62 humor of mine, sir, to take that that no man else
5.4.63 will. Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor
5.4.64 house, as your pearl in your foul oyster.
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
5.4.65 By my faith, he is very swift and
5.4.66 sententious.
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
5.4.67 According to the fool’s bolt, sir, and such
5.4.68 dulcet diseases.
Speaker JAQUES
5.4.69 But for the seventh cause. How did you find the
5.4.70 quarrel on the seventh cause?
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
5.4.71 Upon a lie seven times removed.—Bear
5.4.72 your body more seeming, Audrey.—As thus, sir: I
5.4.73 did dislike the cut of a certain courtier’s beard. He
5.4.74 sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well, he
5.4.75 was in the mind it was. This is called the retortcourteous. If I sent him word again it was not well
5.4.77 cut, he would send me word he cut it to please
5.4.78 himself. This is called the quip modest. If again it
5.4.79 was not well cut, he disabled my judgment. This is
5.4.80 called the reply churlish. If again it was not well
5.4.81 cut, he would answer I spake not true. This is called
5.4.82 the reproof valiant. If again it was not well cut, he
5.4.83 would say I lie. This is called the countercheckquarrelsome, and so to the lie circumstantial,
5.4.85 and the lie direct.
Speaker JAQUES
5.4.86 And how oft did you say his beard was not well
5.4.87 cut?
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
5.4.88 I durst go no further than the lie circumstantial,
5.4.89 nor he durst not give me the lie direct, and
5.4.90 so we measured swords and parted.
Speaker JAQUES
5.4.91 Can you nominate in order now the degrees of
5.4.92 the lie?
Speaker TOUCHSTONE
5.4.93 O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book, as
5.4.94 you have books for good manners. I will name you
5.4.95 the degrees: the first, the retort courteous; the
5.4.96 second, the quip modest; the third, the replychurlish; the fourth, the reproof valiant; the
5.4.98 fifth, the countercheck quarrelsome; the sixth,
5.4.99 the lie with circumstance; the seventh, the liedirect. All these you may avoid but the lie direct,
5.4.101 and you may avoid that too with an if. I knew
5.4.102 when seven justices could not take up a quarrel, but
5.4.103 when the parties were met themselves, one of them
5.4.104 thought but of an if, as: If you said so, then I saidso. And they shook hands and swore brothers.

Speaker SECOND BROTHER
5.4.156 Let me have audience for a word or two.
5.4.157 I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,
5.4.158 That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
5.4.159 Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day
5.4.160 Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
5.4.161 Addressed a mighty power, which were on foot
5.4.162 In his own conduct, purposely to take
5.4.163 His brother here and put him to the sword;
5.4.164 And to the skirts of this wild wood he came,
5.4.165 Where, meeting with an old religious man,
5.4.166 After some question with him, was converted
5.4.167 Both from his enterprise and from the world,
5.4.168 His crown bequeathing to his banished brother,
5.4.169 And all their lands restored to them again
5.4.170 That were with him exiled. This to be true
5.4.171 I do engage my life.
Speaker DUKE SENIOR
5.4.172 Welcome, young man.
5.4.173 Thou offer’st fairly to thy brothers’ wedding:
5.4.174 To one his lands withheld, and to the other
5.4.175 A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.—
5.4.176 First, in this forest let us do those ends
5.4.177 That here were well begun and well begot,
5.4.178 And, after, every of this happy number
5.4.179 That have endured shrewd days and nights with us
5.4.180 Shall share the good of our returnèd fortune
5.4.181 According to the measure of their states.
5.4.182 Meantime, forget this new-fall’n dignity,
5.4.183 And fall into our rustic revelry.—
5.4.184 Play, music.—And you brides and bridegrooms all,
5.4.185 With measure heaped in joy to th’ measures fall.
Speaker JAQUES
Stage Directions , to Second Brother
5.4.186 Sir, by your patience: if I heard you rightly,
5.4.187 The Duke hath put on a religious life
5.4.188 And thrown into neglect the pompous court.
Speaker SECOND BROTHER
5.4.189 He hath.
Speaker JAQUES
5.4.190 To him will I. Out of these convertites
5.4.191 There is much matter to be heard and learned.
5.4.192 To Duke. You to your former honor I bequeath;
5.4.193 Your patience and your virtue well deserves it.
5.4.194 To Orlando. You to a love that your true faith doth
5.4.195 merit.

5.4.197 allies.

5.4.199 To Touchstone. And you to wrangling, for thy
5.4.200 loving voyage
5.4.201 Is but for two months victualled.—So to your

5.4.203 I am for other than for dancing measures.

Stage Directions Dance. All but Rosalind exit.
Stage Directions Dance.
Stage Directions All but Rosalind exit.Scene 5

Speaker ROSALIND
EPI.1 It is not the fashion to see the lady the
EPI.2 epilogue, but it is no more unhandsome than to see
EPI.3 the lord the prologue. If it be true that good wine
EPI.4 needs no bush, ’tis true that a good play needs no
EPI.5 epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes,
EPI.6 and good plays prove the better by the help of good
EPI.7 epilogues. What a case am I in then that am neither
EPI.8 a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with you in
EPI.9 the behalf of a good play! I am not furnished like a
EPI.10 beggar; therefore to beg will not become me. My
EPI.11 way is to conjure you, and I’ll begin with the
EPI.12 women. I charge you, O women, for the love you
EPI.13 bear to men, to like as much of this play as please
EPI.14 you. And I charge you, O men, for the love you bear
EPI.15 to women—as I perceive by your simpering, none
EPI.16 of you hates them—that between you and the
EPI.17 women the play may please. If I were a woman, I
EPI.18 would kiss as many of you as had beards that
EPI.19 pleased me, complexions that liked me, and breaths
EPI.20 that I defied not. And I am sure as many as have
EPI.21 good beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths will for
EPI.22 my kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.
Stage Directions She exits.
