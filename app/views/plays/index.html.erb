Scene 1
</h2>
<br>
<i>Enter Orlando and Adam.</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.1</span>As I remember, Adam, it was upon this
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.2</span>fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.3</span>crowns, and, as thou sayst, charged my brother on
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.4</span>his blessing to breed me well. And there begins my
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.5</span>sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.6</span>report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.7</span>keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.8</span>properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.9</span>that keeping, for a gentleman of my birth, that
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.10</span>differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.11</span>bred better, for, besides that they are fair with their
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.12</span>feeding, they are taught their manage and, to that
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.13</span>end, riders dearly hired. But I, his brother, gain
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.14</span>nothing under him but growth, for the which his
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.15</span>animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.16</span>as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.17</span>me, the something that nature gave me his countenance
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.18</span>seems to take from me. He lets me feed with
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.19</span>his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and, as
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.20</span>much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.21</span>education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me, and the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.22</span>spirit of my father, which I think is within me,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.23</span>begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.24</span>longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.25</span>how to avoid it.
<br>
<i>Enter Oliver.</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.26</span>Yonder comes my master, your brother.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.27</span>Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.28</span>will shake me up.
<br>
<i>Adam steps aside.</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.29</span>Now, sir, what make you here?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.30</span>Nothing. I am not taught to make anything.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.31</span>What mar you then, sir?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.32</span>Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.33</span>which God made, a poor unworthy brother of
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.34</span>yours, with idleness.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.35</span>Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.36</span>awhile.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.37</span>Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.38</span>them? What prodigal portion have I spent that I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.39</span>should come to such penury?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.40</span>Know you where you are, sir?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.41</span>O, sir, very well: here in your orchard.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.42</span>Know you before whom, sir?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.43</span>Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.44</span>know you are my eldest brother, and in the gentle
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.45</span>condition of blood you should so know me. The
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.46</span>courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that you
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.47</span>are the first-born, but the same tradition takes not
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.48</span>away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.49</span>us. I have as much of my father in me as you, albeit I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.50</span>confess your coming before me is nearer to his
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.51</span>reverence.<i>, threatening Orlando</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.52</span>What, boy!<i>, holding off Oliver by the throat</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.53</span>Come,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.54</span>come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.55</span>Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.56</span>I am no villain. I am the youngest son of Sir
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.57</span>Rowland de Boys. He was my father, and he is
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.58</span>thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.59</span>Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.60</span>hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.61</span>thy tongue for saying so. Thou hast railed on thyself.<i>, coming forward</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.62</span>Sweet masters, be patient. For
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.63</span>your father’s remembrance, be at accord.<i>, to Orlando</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.64</span>Let me go, I say.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.65</span>I will not till I please. You shall hear me. My
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.66</span>father charged you in his will to give me good
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.67</span>education. You have trained me like a peasant,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.68</span>obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.69</span>qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.70</span>me, and I will no longer endure it. Therefore allow
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.71</span>me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.72</span>give me the poor allottery my father left me by
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.73</span>testament. With that I will go buy my fortunes.
<br>
<i>Orlando releases Oliver.</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.74</span>And what wilt thou do—beg when that is
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.75</span>spent? Well, sir, get you in. I will not long be
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.76</span>troubled with you. You shall have some part of your
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.77</span>will. I pray you leave me.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.78</span>I will no further offend you than becomes
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.79</span>me for my good.<i>, to Adam</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.80</span>Get you with him, you old dog.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.81</span>Is old dog my reward? Most true, I have lost
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.82</span>my teeth in your service. God be with my old
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.83</span>master. He would not have spoke such a word.
<br>
<i>Orlando and Adam exit.</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.84</span>Is it even so? Begin you to grow upon me? I
<br>

<br>
<i> Dennis exits.</i>
<br>
<i>Enter Charles.</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.94</span>Good morrow to your Worship.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.95</span>Good Monsieur Charles, what’s the new news
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.96</span>at the new court?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.97</span>There’s no news at the court, sir, but the old
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.98</span>news. That is, the old duke is banished by his
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.99</span>younger brother the new duke, and three or four
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.100</span>loving lords have put themselves into voluntary
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.101</span>exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.102</span>the new duke. Therefore he gives them good leave
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.103</span>to wander.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.104</span>Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke’s daughter,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.105</span>be banished with her father?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.106</span>O, no, for the Duke’s daughter her cousin so
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.107</span>loves her, being ever from their cradles bred together,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.108</span>that she would have followed her exile or have
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.109</span>died to stay behind her. She is at the court and no
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.110</span>less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.111</span>and never two ladies loved as they do.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.112</span>Where will the old duke live?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.113</span>They say he is already in the Forest of Arden,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.114</span>and a many merry men with him; and there they
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.115</span>live like the old Robin Hood of England. They say
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.116</span>many young gentlemen flock to him every day and
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.117</span>fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.118</span>world.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.119</span>What, you wrestle tomorrow before the new
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.120</span>duke?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.121</span>Marry, do I, sir, and I came to acquaint you
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.122</span>with a matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.123</span>that your younger brother Orlando hath a
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.124</span>disposition to come in disguised against me to try a
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.125</span>fall. Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit, and he
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.126</span>that escapes me without some broken limb shall
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.127</span>acquit him well. Your brother is but young and
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.128</span>tender, and for your love I would be loath to foil
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.129</span>him, as I must for my own honor if he come in.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.130</span>Therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.131</span>acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.132</span>from his intendment, or brook such disgrace well
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.133</span>as he shall run into, in that it is a thing of his own
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.134</span>search, and altogether against my will.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.135</span>Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.136</span>thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.137</span>myself notice of my brother’s purpose herein, and
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.138</span>have by underhand means labored to dissuade him
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.139</span>from it; but he is resolute. I’ll tell thee, Charles, it is
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.140</span>the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.141</span>ambition, an envious emulator of every man’s good
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.142</span>parts, a secret and villainous contriver against me
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.143</span>his natural brother. Therefore use thy discretion. I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.144</span>had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.145</span>And thou wert best look to ’t, for if thou dost him
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.146</span>any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.147</span>himself on thee, he will practice against thee by
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.148</span>poison, entrap thee by some treacherous device,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.149</span>and never leave thee till he hath ta’en thy life by
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.150</span>some indirect means or other. For I assure thee—
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.151</span>and almost with tears I speak it—there is not one so
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.152</span>young and so villainous this day living. I speak but
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.153</span>brotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.154</span>thee as he is, I must blush and weep, and thou must
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.155</span>look pale and wonder.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.156</span>I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.157</span>come tomorrow, I’ll give him his payment. If ever
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.158</span>he go alone again, I’ll never wrestle for prize more.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.159</span>And so God keep your Worship.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.160</span>Farewell, good Charles.Charles exits.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.161</span>Now will I stir this gamester. I hope I shall see an
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.162</span>end of him, for my soul—yet I know not why—
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.163</span>hates nothing more than he. Yet he’s gentle, never
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.164</span>schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of all
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.165</span>sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much in
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.166</span>the heart of the world, and especially of my own
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.167</span>people, who best know him, that I am altogether
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.168</span>misprized. But it shall not be so long; this wrestler
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.169</span>shall clear all. Nothing remains but that I kindle the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.1.170</span>boy thither, which now I’ll go about.

</h2>
<br>
<i>Enter Rosalind and Celia.</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.1</span>I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.2</span>Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.3</span>mistress of, and would you yet I were merrier?
<br>
<span class="one"><span class="lineNum">1.2.4</span>Unless you could teach me to forget a banished</span>
<br>
<span class="two"><span class="lineNum">1.2.5</span>father, you must not learn me how to remember</span>
<br>
<span class="three"><span class="lineNum">1.2.6</span>any extraordinary pleasure.</span>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.7</span>Herein I see thou lov’st me not with the full
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.8</span>weight that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.9</span>father, had banished thy uncle, the Duke my father,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.10</span>so thou hadst been still with me, I could have taught
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.11</span>my love to take thy father for mine. So wouldst thou,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.12</span>if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.13</span>tempered as mine is to thee.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.14</span>Well, I will forget the condition of my estate
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.15</span>to rejoice in yours.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.16</span>You know my father hath no child but I, nor
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.17</span>none is like to have; and truly, when he dies, thou
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.18</span>shalt be his heir, for what he hath taken away from
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.19</span>thy father perforce, I will render thee again in
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.20</span>affection. By mine honor I will, and when I break
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.21</span>that oath, let me turn monster. Therefore, my sweet
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.22</span>Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.23</span>From henceforth I will, coz, and devise
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.24</span>sports. Let me see—what think you of falling in
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.25</span>love?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.26</span>Marry, I prithee do, to make sport withal; but
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.27</span>love no man in good earnest, nor no further in
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.28</span>sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.29</span>mayst in honor come off again.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.30</span>What shall be our sport, then?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.31</span>Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.32</span>from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.33</span>bestowed equally.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.34</span>I would we could do so, for her benefits are
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.35</span>mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.36</span>doth most mistake in her gifts to women.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.37</span>’Tis true, for those that she makes fair she scarce
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.38</span>makes honest, and those that she makes honest she
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.39</span>makes very ill-favoredly.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.40</span>Nay, now thou goest from Fortune’s office to
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.41</span>Nature’s. Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.42</span>the lineaments of nature.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.43</span>No? When Nature hath made a fair creature,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.44</span>may she not by fortune fall into the fire?Enter Touchstone.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.45</span>Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.46</span>hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.47</span>argument?
<br>
<i>Enter Touchstone.</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.48</span>Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.49</span>when Fortune makes Nature’s natural the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.50</span>cutter-off of Nature’s wit.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.51</span>Peradventure this is not Fortune’s work neither,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.52</span>but Nature’s, who perceiveth our natural wits too
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.53</span>dull to reason of such goddesses, and hath sent
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.54</span>this natural for our whetstone, for always the dullness
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.55</span>of the fool is the whetstone of the wits. ToTouchstone. 
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.56</span>How now, wit, whither wander you?
<br>
<i> ToTouchstone. </i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.57</span>Mistress, you must come away to your
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.58</span>father.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.59</span>Were you made the messenger?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.60</span>No, by mine honor, but I was bid to come
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.61</span>for you.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.62</span>Where learned you that oath, fool?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.63</span>Of a certain knight that swore by his
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.64</span>honor they were good pancakes, and swore by his
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.65</span>honor the mustard was naught. Now, I’ll stand to it,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.66</span>the pancakes were naught and the mustard was
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.67</span>good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.68</span>How prove you that in the great heap of your
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.69</span>knowledge?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.70</span>Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.71</span>Stand you both forth now: stroke your
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.72</span>chins, and swear by your beards that I am a knave.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.73</span>By our beards (if we had them), thou art.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.74</span>By my knavery (if I had it), then I were.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.75</span>But if you swear by that that is not, you are not
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.76</span>forsworn. No more was this knight swearing by his
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.77</span>honor, for he never had any, or if he had, he had
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.78</span>sworn it away before ever he saw those pancakes or
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.79</span>that mustard.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.80</span>Prithee, who is ’t that thou mean’st?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.81</span>One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.82</span>My father’s love is enough to honor him.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.83</span>Enough. Speak no more of him; you’ll be whipped
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.84</span>for taxation one of these days.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.85</span>The more pity that fools may not speak
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.86</span>wisely what wise men do foolishly.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.87</span>By my troth, thou sayest true. For, since the little
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.88</span>wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.89</span>that wise men have makes a great show. Here
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.90</span>comes Monsieur Le Beau.
<br>
<i>Enter Le Beau.</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.91</span>With his mouth full of news.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.92</span>Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.93</span>young.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.94</span>Then shall we be news-crammed.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.95</span>All the better. We shall be the more
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.96</span>marketable.—Bonjour, Monsieur Le Beau. What’s
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.97</span>the news?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.98</span>Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.99</span>Sport? Of what color?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.100</span>What color, madam? How shall I answer you?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.101</span>As wit and fortune will.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.102</span>Or as the destinies decrees.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.103</span>Well said. That was laid on with a trowel.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.104</span>Nay, if I keep not my rank—
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.105</span>Thou losest thy old smell.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.106</span>You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.107</span>good wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.108</span>Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.109</span>I will tell you the beginning, and if it please
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.110</span>your Ladyships, you may see the end, for the best is
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.111</span>yet to do, and here, where you are, they are coming
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.112</span>to perform it.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.113</span>Well, the beginning that is dead and buried.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.114</span>There comes an old man and his three sons—
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.115</span>I could match this beginning with an old tale.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.116</span>Three proper young men of excellent growth
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.117</span>and presence.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.118</span>With bills on their necks: Be it known untoall men by these presents.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.120</span>The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.121</span>the Duke’s wrestler, which Charles in a moment
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.122</span>threw him and broke three of his ribs, that there is
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.123</span>little hope of life in him. So he served the second,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.124</span>and so the third. Yonder they lie, the poor old man
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.125</span>their father making such pitiful dole over them that
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.126</span>all the beholders take his part with weeping.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.127</span>Alas!
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.128</span>But what is the sport, monsieur, that the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.129</span>ladies have lost?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.130</span>Why, this that I speak of.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.131</span>Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.132</span>the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.133</span>sport for ladies.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.134</span>Or I, I promise thee.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.135</span>But is there any else longs to see this broken
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.136</span>music in his sides? Is there yet another dotes upon
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.137</span>rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.138</span>You must if you stay here, for here is the place
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.139</span>appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.140</span>perform it.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.141</span>Yonder sure they are coming. Let us now stay
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.142</span>and see it.
<br>
<i>Flourish. Enter Duke Frederick, Lords, Orlando,Charles, and Attendants.</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.143</span>Come on. Since the youth will not be
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.144</span>entreated, his own peril on his forwardness.<i>, to Le Beau</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.145</span>Is yonder the man?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.146</span>Even he, madam.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.147</span>Alas, he is too young. Yet he looks successfully.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.148</span>How now, daughter and cousin? Are
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.149</span>you crept hither to see the wrestling?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.150</span>Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.151</span>You will take little delight in it, I can
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.152</span>tell you, there is such odds in the man. In pity of the
<br>

<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.158</span>Monsieur the challenger, the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.159</span>Princess calls for you.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.160</span>I attend them with all respect and duty.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.161</span>Young man, have you challenged Charles the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.162</span>wrestler?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.163</span>No, fair princess. He is the general challenger.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.164</span>I come but in as others do, to try with him the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.165</span>strength of my youth.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.166</span>Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.167</span>your years. You have seen cruel proof of this man’s
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.168</span>strength. If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.169</span>yourself with your judgment, the fear of your adventure
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.170</span>would counsel you to a more equal enterprise.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.171</span>We pray you for your own sake to embrace your
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.172</span>own safety and give over this attempt.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.173</span>Do, young sir. Your reputation shall not
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.174</span>therefore be misprized. We will make it our suit to
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.175</span>the Duke that the wrestling might not go forward.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.176</span>I beseech you, punish me not with your hard
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.177</span>thoughts, wherein I confess me much guilty to deny
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.178</span>so fair and excellent ladies anything. But let your
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.179</span>fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.180</span>wherein, if I be foiled, there is but one shamed that
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.181</span>was never gracious; if killed, but one dead that is
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.182</span>willing to be so. I shall do my friends no wrong, for
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.183</span>I have none to lament me; the world no injury, for
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.184</span>in it I have nothing. Only in the world I fill up a
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.185</span>place which may be better supplied when I have
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.186</span>made it empty.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.187</span>The little strength that I have, I would it
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.188</span>were with you.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.189</span>And mine, to eke out hers.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.190</span>Fare you well. Pray heaven I be deceived in
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.191</span>you.
<br>

<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.194</span>desirous to lie with his mother Earthearth?
<br>

<span class="lineNum">1.2.272</span>Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.273</span>But yet indeed the smaller is his daughter.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.2.274</span>The other is daughter to the banished duke,

<br>

<span class="lineNum">1.3.13</span>They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in

<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.3.56</span>If their purgation did consist in words,

<span class="lineNum">1.3.71</span>Else had she with her father ranged along.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.3.72</span>I did not then entreat to have her stay.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.3.73</span>It was your pleasure and your own remorse.
<br>

<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.3.83</span>Thou art a fool. She robs thee of thy name,

<span class="lineNum">1.3.86</span>When she is gone. Then open not thy lips.
<br>

<span class="lineNum">1.3.111</span>Say what thou canst, I’ll go along with thee.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.3.112</span>Why, whither shall we go?

<span class="lineNum">1.3.128</span>As many other mannish cowards have

<span class="lineNum">1.3.129</span>That do outface it with their semblances.

<span class="lineNum">1.3.131</span>I’ll have no worse a name than Jove’s own page,

<span class="lineNum">1.3.132</span>And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.3.133</span>But what will you be called?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.3.134</span>Something that hath a reference to my state:
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.3.135</span>No longer Celia, but Aliena.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.3.136</span>But, cousin, what if we assayed to steal
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.3.137</span>The clownish fool out of your father’s court?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.3.138</span>Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.3.139</span>He’ll go along o’er the wide world with me.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.3.140</span>Leave me alone to woo him. Let’s away
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.3.141</span>And get our jewels and our wealth together,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.3.142</span>Devise the fittest time and safest way
<br>
<span class="lineNum">1.3.143</span>To hide us from pursuit that will be made

<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.2</span>Hath not old custom made this life more sweet

<span class="lineNum">2.1.7</span>And churlish chiding of the winter’s wind,

<span class="lineNum">2.1.9</span>Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.10</span>This is no flattery. These are counselorsThat feelingly persuade me what I am.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.12</span>Sweet are the uses of adversity,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.13</span>Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.14</span>Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.15</span>And this our life, exempt from public haunt,

<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.18</span>I would not change it. Happy is your Grace,

<span class="lineNum">2.1.19</span>That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.20</span>Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.21</span>Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.22</span>And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.23</span>Being native burghers of this desert city,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.24</span>Should in their own confines with forkèd heads

<span class="lineNum">2.1.25</span>Have their round haunches gored.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.26</span>Indeed, my lord,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.27</span>The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.28</span>And in that kind swears you do more usurp
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.29</span>Than doth your brother that hath banished you.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.30</span>Today my Lord of Amiens and myself
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.31</span>Did steal behind him as he lay along
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.32</span>Under an oak, whose antique root peeps out
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.33</span>Upon the brook that brawls along this wood;

<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.35</span>That from the hunter’s aim had ta’en a hurt
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.36</span>Did come to languish. And indeed, my lord,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.37</span>The wretched animal heaved forth such groans
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.38</span>That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.39</span>Almost to bursting, and the big round tears
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.40</span>Coursed one another down his innocent nose
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.41</span>In piteous chase. And thus the hairy fool,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.42</span>Much markèd of the melancholy Jaques,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.43</span>Stood on th’ extremest verge of the swift brook,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.44</span>Augmenting it with tears.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.45</span>But what said Jaques?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.46</span>Did he not moralize this spectacle?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.47</span>O yes, into a thousand similes.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.48</span>First, for his weeping into the needless stream:
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.49</span>Poor deer, quoth he, thou mak’st a testamentAs worldlings do, giving thy sum of moreTo that which had too much. Then, being there
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.52</span>alone,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.53</span>Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.54</span>’Tis right, quoth he. Thus misery doth partACT 2. SC. 2The flux of company. Anon a careless herd,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.56</span>Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.57</span>And never stays to greet him. Ay, quoth Jaques,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.58</span>Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens.’Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you lookUpon that poor and broken bankrupt there?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.61</span>Thus most invectively he pierceth through
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.62</span>The body of country, city, court,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.63</span>Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we

<span class="lineNum">2.1.64</span>Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what’s worse,

<span class="lineNum">2.1.66</span>In their assigned and native dwelling place.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.67</span>And did you leave him in this contemplation?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.68</span>We did, my lord, weeping and commenting

<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.70</span>Show me the place.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.1.71</span>I love to cope him in these sullen fits,

<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.3.48</span>Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty,

<span class="lineNum">2.3.62</span>And having that do choke their service up

<span class="lineNum">2.4.33</span>If thou rememb’rest not the slightest folly
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.34</span>That ever love did make thee run into,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.35</span>Thou hast not loved.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.36</span>Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.37</span>Wearing thy hearer in thy mistress’ praise,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.38</span>Thou hast not loved.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.39</span>Or if thou hast not broke from company
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.40</span>Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.41</span>Thou hast not loved.

<i>He exits.</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.43</span>Alas, poor shepherd, searching of thy wound,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.44</span>I have by hard adventure found mine own.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.45</span>And I mine. I remember when I was in
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.46</span>love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.47</span>take that for coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.48</span>remember the kissing of her batler, and the cow’s
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.49</span>dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked;
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.50</span>and I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.51</span>her, from whom I took two cods and, giving her
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.52</span>them again, said with weeping tears Wear these formy sake. We that are true lovers run into strange
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.54</span>capers. But as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.55</span>in love mortal in folly.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.56</span>Thou speak’st wiser than thou art ware of.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.57</span>Nay, I shall ne’er be ware of mine own
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.58</span>wit till I break my shins against it.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.59</span>Jove, Jove, this shepherd’s passion
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.60</span>Is much upon my fashion.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.4.61</span>And mine, but it grows something stale

<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.14</span>As I do live by food, I met a fool,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.15</span>Who laid him down and basked him in the sun
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.16</span>And railed on Lady Fortune in good terms,

<span class="lineNum">2.7.17</span>In good set terms, and yet a motley fool.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.18</span>Good morrow, fool, quoth I. No, sir, quoth he,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.19</span>Call me not fool till heaven hath sent mefortune.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.21</span>And then he drew a dial from his poke
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.22</span>And, looking on it with lack-luster eye,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.23</span>Says very wisely It is ten o’clock.Thus we may see, quoth he, how the world wags.’Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,And after one hour more ’twill be eleven.And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe,And then from hour to hour we rot and rot,And thereby hangs a tale. When I did hear
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.30</span>The motley fool thus moral on the time,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.31</span>My lungs began to crow like chanticleer
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.32</span>That fools should be so deep-contemplative,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.33</span>And I did laugh sans intermission
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.34</span>An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.35</span>A worthy fool! Motley’s the only wear.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.36</span>What fool is this?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.37</span>O worthy fool!—One that hath been a courtier,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.38</span>And says If ladies be but young and fair,They have the gift to know it. And in his brain,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.40</span>Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit

<span class="lineNum">2.7.41</span>After a voyage, he hath strange places crammed

<span class="lineNum">2.7.52</span>And they that are most gallèd with my folly,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.53</span>They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.54</span>The why is plain as way to parish church:
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.55</span>He that a fool doth very wisely hit
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.56</span>Doth very foolishly, although he smart,

<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.58</span>The wise man’s folly is anatomized
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.59</span>Even by the squand’ring glances of the fool.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.60</span>Invest me in my motley. Give me leave

<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.111</span>Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.112</span>I thought that all things had been savage here,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.113</span>And therefore put I on the countenance

<span class="lineNum">2.7.114</span>Of stern commandment. But whate’er you are

<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.121</span>If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.122</span>And know what ’tis to pity and be pitied,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.123</span>Let gentleness my strong enforcement be,

<i>He sheathes his sword.</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.125</span>True is it that we have seen better days,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.126</span>And have with holy bell been knolled to church,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.127</span>And sat at good men’s feasts and wiped our eyes
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.128</span>Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.129</span>And therefore sit you down in gentleness,

<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.135</span>Who after me hath many a weary step
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.136</span>Limped in pure love. Till he be first sufficed,

<span class="lineNum">2.7.137</span>Oppressed with two weak evils, age and hunger,

<i>He exits.</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.142</span>Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.143</span>This wide and universal theater
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.144</span>Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.145</span>Wherein we play in.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.146</span>All the world’s a stage,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.147</span>And all the men and women merely players.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.148</span>They have their exits and their entrances,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.149</span>And one man in his time plays many parts,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.150</span>His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.151</span>Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.152</span>Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.153</span>And shining morning face, creeping like snail
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.154</span>Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.155</span>Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.156</span>Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.157</span>Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.158</span>Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.159</span>Seeking the bubble reputation
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.160</span>Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.161</span>In fair round belly with good capon lined,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.162</span>With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.163</span>Full of wise saws and modern instances;
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.164</span>And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.165</span>Into the lean and slippered pantaloon
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.166</span>With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.167</span>His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.168</span>For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.169</span>Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.170</span>And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.171</span>That ends this strange eventful history,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">2.7.172</span>Is second childishness and mere oblivion,

<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.11</span>And how like you this shepherd’s life, Master
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.12</span>Touchstone?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.13</span>Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.14</span>good life; but in respect that it is a shepherd’s life, it
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.15</span>is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I like it very
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.16</span>well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.17</span>life. Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.18</span>well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.19</span>tedious. As it is a spare life, look you, it fits my
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.20</span>humor well; but as there is no more plenty in it, it
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.21</span>goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.22</span>in thee, shepherd?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.23</span>No more but that I know the more one sickens,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.24</span>the worse at ease he is, and that he that wants
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.25</span>money, means, and content is without three good
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.26</span>friends; that the property of rain is to wet, and fire
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.27</span>to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.28</span>a great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.29</span>that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.30</span>complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.31</span>kindred.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.32</span>Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.33</span>ever in court, shepherd?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.34</span>No, truly.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.35</span>Then thou art damned.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.36</span>Nay, I hope.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.37</span>Truly, thou art damned, like an ill-roasted
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.38</span>egg, all on one side.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.39</span>For not being at court? Your reason.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.40</span>Why, if thou never wast at court, thou
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.41</span>never saw’st good manners; if thou never saw’st
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.42</span>good manners, then thy manners must be wicked,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.43</span>and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.44</span>art in a parlous state, shepherd.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.45</span>Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.46</span>manners at the court are as ridiculous in the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.47</span>country as the behavior of the country is most
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.48</span>mockable at the court. You told me you salute not at
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.49</span>the court but you kiss your hands. That courtesy
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.50</span>would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.51</span>Instance, briefly. Come, instance.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.52</span>Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.53</span>fells, you know, are greasy.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.54</span>Why, do not your courtier’s hands sweat?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.55</span>And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.56</span>the sweat of a man? Shallow, shallow. A better
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.57</span>instance, I say. Come.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.58</span>Besides, our hands are hard.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.59</span>Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.60</span>again. A more sounder instance. Come.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.61</span>And they are often tarred over with the surgery
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.62</span>of our sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.63</span>courtier’s hands are perfumed with civet.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.64</span>Most shallow man. Thou worms’ meat in
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.65</span>respect of a good piece of flesh, indeed. Learn of the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.66</span>wise and perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.67</span>the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.68</span>shepherd.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.69</span>You have too courtly a wit for me. I’ll rest.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.70</span>Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.71</span>shallow man. God make incision in thee; thou art
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.72</span>raw.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.73</span>Sir, I am a true laborer. I earn that I eat, get that
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.74</span>I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man’s happiness,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.75</span>glad of other men’s good, content with my harm,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.76</span>and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.77</span>and my lambs suck.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.78</span>That is another simple sin in you, to bring
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.79</span>the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.80</span>your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.81</span>a bell-wether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.82</span>to a crooked-pated old cuckoldly ram, out of
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.83</span>all reasonable match. If thou be’st not damned for
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.84</span>this, the devil himself will have no shepherds. I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.85</span>cannot see else how thou shouldst ’scape.

<span class="lineNum">3.2.106</span>So must slender Rosalind.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.107</span>They that reap must sheaf and bind;
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.108</span>Then to cart with Rosalind.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.109</span>Sweetest nut hath sourest rind;
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.110</span>Such a nut is Rosalind.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.111</span>He that sweetest rose will find
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.112</span>Must find love’s prick, and Rosalind.For a taste:
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.113</span>This is the very false gallop of verses. Why do you
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.114</span>infect yourself with them?<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.115</span>Peace, you dull fool. I found
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.116</span>them on a tree.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.117</span>Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.118</span>I’ll graft it with you, and
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.119</span>then I shall graft it with a medlar. Then it will be
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.120</span>the earliest fruit i’ th’ country, for you’ll be rotten
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.121</span>ere you be half ripe, and that’s the right virtue of
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.122</span>the medlar.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.123</span>You have said, but whether wisely or no,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.124</span>let the forest judge.
<br>
<i>Enter Celia, as Aliena, with a writing.</i><i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.125</span>Peace. Here comes my sister
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.126</span>reading. Stand aside.<i>, as Aliena, reads</i>
<br>
<i>as Aliena</i>
<br>
<i>reads</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.127</span>Why should this a desert be?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.128</span>For it is unpeopled? No.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.129</span>Tongues I’ll hang on every tree
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.130</span>That shall civil sayings show.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.131</span>Some how brief the life of man
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.132</span>Runs his erring pilgrimage,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.133</span>That the stretching of a span
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.134</span>Buckles in his sum of age;
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.135</span>Some of violated vows
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.136</span>’Twixt the souls of friend and friend.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.137</span>But upon the fairest boughs,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.138</span>Or at every sentence’sentence end,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.139</span>Will I Rosalinda write,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.140</span>Teaching all that read to know
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.141</span>The quintessence of every sprite
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.142</span>Heaven would in little show.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.143</span>Therefore heaven nature charged
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.144</span>That one body should be filled
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.145</span>With all graces wide-enlarged.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.146</span>Nature presently distilled
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.147</span>Helen’s cheek, but not her heart,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.148</span>Cleopatra’s majesty,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.149</span>Atalanta’s better part,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.150</span>Sad Lucretia’s modesty.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.151</span>Thus Rosalind of many parts
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.152</span>By heavenly synod was devised
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.153</span>Of many faces, eyes, and hearts
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.154</span>To have the touches dearest prized.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.155</span>Heaven would that she these gifts should have
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.156</span>And I to live and die her slave.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.157</span>O most gentle Jupiter, what
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.158</span>tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.159</span>withal, and never cried Have patience,good people!.<i>, as Aliena</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.161</span>How now?—Back, friends. Shepherd,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.162</span>go off a little.—Go with him, sirrah.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.163</span>Come, shepherd, let us make an honorable
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.164</span>retreat, though not with bag and baggage, yet
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.165</span>with scrip and scrippage.
<br>
<i>Touchstone and Corin exit.</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.166</span>Didst thou hear these verses?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.167</span>O yes, I heard them all, and more too, for
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.168</span>some of them had in them more feet than the verses
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.169</span>would bear.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.170</span>That’s no matter. The feet might bear the verses.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.171</span>Ay, but the feet were lame and could not
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.172</span>bear themselves without the verse, and therefore
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.173</span>stood lamely in the verse.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.174</span>But didst thou hear without wondering how thy
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.175</span>name should be hanged and carved upon these
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.176</span>trees?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.177</span>I was seven of the nine days out of the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.178</span>wonder before you came, for look here what I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.179</span>found on a palm tree. She shows the paper sheread. 
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.180</span>I was never so berhymed since Pythagoras’
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.181</span>time that I was an Irish rat, which I can hardly
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.182</span>remember.
<br>
<i> She shows the paper sheread. </i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.183</span>Trow you who hath done this?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.184</span>Is it a man?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.185</span>And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.186</span>Change you color?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.187</span>I prithee, who?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.188</span>O Lord, Lord, it is a hard matter for friends to
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.189</span>meet, but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.190</span>and so encounter.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.191</span>Nay, but who is it?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.192</span>Is it possible?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.193</span>Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.194</span>vehemence, tell me who it is.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.195</span>O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.196</span>wonderful, and yet again wonderful, and after that
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.197</span>out of all whooping!
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.198</span>Good my complexion, dost thou think
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.199</span>though I am caparisoned like a man, I have a
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.200</span>doublet and hose in my disposition? One inch of
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.201</span>delay more is a South Sea of discovery. I prithee,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.202</span>tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. I would
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.203</span>thou couldst stammer, that thou might’st pour this
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.204</span>concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.205</span>of a narrow-mouthed bottle—either too much at
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.206</span>once, or none at all. I prithee take the cork out of
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.207</span>thy mouth, that I may drink thy tidings.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.208</span>So you may put a man in your belly.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.209</span>Is he of God’s making? What manner of
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.210</span>man? Is his head worth a hat, or his chin worth a
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.211</span>beard?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.212</span>Nay, he hath but a little beard.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.213</span>Why, God will send more, if the man will be
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.214</span>thankful. Let me stay the growth of his beard, if
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.215</span>thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.216</span>It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler’s
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.217</span>heels and your heart both in an instant.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.218</span>Nay, but the devil take mocking. Speak sad
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.219</span>brow and true maid.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.220</span>I’ faith, coz, ’tis he.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.221</span>Orlando?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.222</span>Orlando.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.223</span>Alas the day, what shall I do with my doublet
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.224</span>and hose? What did he when thou saw’st him? What
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.225</span>said he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.226</span>makes he here? Did he ask for me? Where remains
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.227</span>he? How parted he with thee? And when shalt thou
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.228</span>see him again? Answer me in one word.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.229</span>You must borrow me Gargantua’s mouth first.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.230</span>’Tis a word too great for any mouth of this age’s size.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.231</span>To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.232</span>answer in a catechism.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.233</span>But doth he know that I am in this forest and
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.234</span>in man’s apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.235</span>day he wrestled?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.236</span>It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.237</span>propositions of a lover. But take a taste of my
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.238</span>finding him, and relish it with good observance. I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.239</span>found him under a tree like a dropped acorn.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.240</span>It may well be called Jove’s tree when it
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.241</span>drops forth such fruit.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.242</span>Give me audience, good madam.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.243</span>Proceed.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.244</span>There lay he, stretched along like a wounded
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.245</span>knight.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.246</span>Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.247</span>becomes the ground.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.248</span>Cry holla to thy tongue, I prithee. It curvets
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.249</span>unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.250</span>O, ominous! He comes to kill my heart.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.251</span>I would sing my song without a burden. Thou
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.252</span>bring’st me out of tune.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.253</span>Do you not know I am a woman? When I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.254</span>think, I must speak. Sweet, say on.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.255</span>You bring me out.Enter Orlando and Jaques.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.256</span>Soft, comes he not here?
<br>
<i>Enter Orlando and Jaques.</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.257</span>’Tis he. Slink by, and note him.
<br>
<i>Rosalind and Celia step aside.</i><i>, to Orlando</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.258</span>I thank you for your company,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.259</span>but, good faith, I had as lief have been myself alone.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.260</span>And so had I, but yet, for fashion sake, I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.261</span>thank you too for your society.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.262</span>God be wi’ you. Let’s meet as little as we can.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.263</span>I do desire we may be better strangers.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.264</span>I pray you mar no more trees with writing love
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.265</span>songs in their barks.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.266</span>I pray you mar no more of my verses with
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.267</span>reading them ill-favoredly.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.268</span>Rosalind is your love’s name?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.269</span>Yes, just.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.270</span>I do not like her name.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.271</span>There was no thought of pleasing you when
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.272</span>she was christened.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.273</span>What stature is she of?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.274</span>Just as high as my heart.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.275</span>You are full of pretty answers. Have you not
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.276</span>been acquainted with goldsmiths’ wives and
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.277</span>conned them out of rings?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.278</span>Not so. But I answer you right painted cloth,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.279</span>from whence you have studied your questions.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.280</span>You have a nimble wit. I think ’twas made of
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.281</span>Atalanta’s heels. Will you sit down with me? And we
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.282</span>two will rail against our mistress the world and all
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.283</span>our misery.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.284</span>I will chide no breather in the world but
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.285</span>myself, against whom I know most faults.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.286</span>The worst fault you have is to be in love.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.287</span>’Tis a fault I will not change for your best
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.288</span>virtue. I am weary of you.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.289</span>By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.290</span>found you.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.291</span>He is drowned in the brook. Look but in, and
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.292</span>you shall see him.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.293</span>There I shall see mine own figure.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.294</span>Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.295</span>I’ll tarry no longer with you. Farewell, good
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.296</span>Signior Love.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.297</span>I am glad of your departure. Adieu, good
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.298</span>Monsieur Melancholy.
<br>
<i>Jaques exits.</i><i>, aside to Celia</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.299</span>I will speak to him like a
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.300</span>saucy lackey, and under that habit play the knave
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.301</span>with him. As Ganymede. Do you hear, forester?
<br>
<i>As Ganymede. </i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.302</span>Very well. What would you?<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.303</span>I pray you, what is ’t
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.304</span>o’clock?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.305</span>You should ask me what time o’ day. There’s
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.306</span>no clock in the forest.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.307</span>Then there is no true lover
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.308</span>in the forest; else sighing every minute and
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.309</span>groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.310</span>time as well as a clock.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.311</span>And why not the swift foot of time? Had not
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.312</span>that been as proper?<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.313</span>By no means, sir. Time
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.314</span>travels in divers paces with divers persons. I’ll tell
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.315</span>you who time ambles withal, who time trots withal,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.316</span>who time gallops withal, and who he stands still

<span class="lineNum">3.2.318</span>I prithee, who doth he trot withal?<i>, as Ganymede</i>

<span class="lineNum">3.2.319</span>Marry, he trots hard with a
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.320</span>young maid between the contract of her marriage
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.321</span>and the day it is solemnized. If the interim be but a
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.322</span>se’nnight, time’s pace is so hard that it seems the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.323</span>length of seven year.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.324</span>Who ambles time withal?<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.325</span>With a priest that lacks Latin
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.326</span>and a rich man that hath not the gout, for the one
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.327</span>sleeps easily because he cannot study, and the other
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.328</span>lives merrily because he feels no pain—the one
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.329</span>lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.330</span>the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.331</span>penury. These time ambles withal.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.332</span>Who doth he gallop withal?<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.333</span>With a thief to the gallows,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.334</span>for though he go as softly as foot can fall, he thinks
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.335</span>himself too soon there.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.336</span>Who stays it still withal?<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.337</span>With lawyers in the vacation,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.338</span>for they sleep between term and term, and

<span class="lineNum">3.2.339</span>then they perceive not how time moves.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.340</span>Where dwell you, pretty youth?<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.341</span>With this shepherdess, my
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.342</span>sister, here in the skirts of the forest, like fringe
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.343</span>upon a petticoat.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.344</span>Are you native of this place?<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>

<span class="lineNum">3.2.347</span>Your accent is something finer than you
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.348</span>could purchase in so removed a dwelling.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.349</span>I have been told so of many.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.350</span>But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.351</span>me to speak, who was in his youth an inland man,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.352</span>one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.353</span>love. I have heard him read many lectures against it,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.354</span>and I thank God I am not a woman, to be touched
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.355</span>with so many giddy offenses as he hath generally
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.356</span>taxed their whole sex withal.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.357</span>Can you remember any of the principal evils
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.358</span>that he laid to the charge of women?<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.359</span>There were none principal.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.360</span>They were all like one another as halfpence are,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.361</span>every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.362</span>fault came to match it.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.363</span>I prithee recount some of them.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.364</span>No, I will not cast away my
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.365</span>physic but on those that are sick. There is a man
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.366</span>haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.367</span>carving Rosalind on their barks, hangs odes upon
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.368</span>hawthorns and elegies on brambles, all, forsooth,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.369</span>deifying the name of Rosalind. If I could meet
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.370</span>that fancy-monger, I would give him some good
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.371</span>counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.372</span>upon him.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.373</span>I am he that is so love-shaked. I pray you tell
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.374</span>me your remedy.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.375</span>There is none of my uncle’s
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.376</span>marks upon you. He taught me how to know a man
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.377</span>in love, in which cage of rushes I am sure you are
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.378</span>not prisoner.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.379</span>What were his marks?<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.380</span>A lean cheek, which you
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.381</span>have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.382</span>not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.383</span>beard neglected, which you have not—but I pardon
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.384</span>you for that, for simply your having in beard is a
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.385</span>younger brother’s revenue. Then your hose should
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.386</span>be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.387</span>unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.388</span>about you demonstrating a careless desolation. But
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.389</span>you are no such man. You are rather point-device in
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.390</span>your accouterments, as loving yourself than seeming
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.391</span>the lover of any other.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.392</span>Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.393</span>I love.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.394</span>Me believe it? You may as
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.395</span>soon make her that you love believe it, which I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.396</span>warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.397</span>That is one of the points in the which women still
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.398</span>give the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.399</span>are you he that hangs the verses on the trees
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.400</span>wherein Rosalind is so admired?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.401</span>I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.402</span>Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.403</span>But are you so much in love
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.404</span>as your rhymes speak?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.405</span>Neither rhyme nor reason can express how
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.406</span>much.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.407</span>Love is merely a madness,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.408</span>and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.409</span>whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.410</span>not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.411</span>ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.412</span>profess curing it by counsel.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.413</span>Did you ever cure any so?<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.414</span>Yes, one, and in this manner.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.415</span>He was to imagine me his love, his mistress,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.416</span>and I set him every day to woo me; at which time
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.417</span>would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.418</span>effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.419</span>fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.420</span>full of smiles; for every passion something, and for
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.421</span>no passion truly anything, as boys and women are,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.422</span>for the most part, cattle of this color; would now
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.423</span>like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.424</span>forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.425</span>that I drave my suitor from his mad humor of love
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.426</span>to a living humor of madness, which was to forswear
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.427</span>the full stream of the world and to live in a
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.428</span>nook merely monastic. And thus I cured him, and
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.429</span>this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.430</span>clean as a sound sheep’s heart, that there shall not
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.431</span>be one spot of love in ’t.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.432</span>I would not be cured, youth.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.433</span>I would cure you if you
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.434</span>would but call me Rosalind and come every day to
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.435</span>my cote and woo me.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.436</span>Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.437</span>where it is.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.438</span>Go with me to it, and I’ll
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.439</span>show it you; and by the way you shall tell me where
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.440</span>in the forest you live. Will you go?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.441</span>With all my heart, good youth.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.442</span>Nay, you must call me
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.2.443</span>Rosalind.—Come, sister, will you go?
<br>

<br>
<i>Enter Touchstone and Audrey, followed by Jaques.</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.1</span>Come apace, good Audrey. I will fetch up
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.2</span>your goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? Am I the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.3</span>man yet? Doth my simple feature content you?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.4</span>Your features, Lord warrant us! What
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.5</span>features?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.6</span>I am here with thee and thy goats, as the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.7</span>most capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.8</span>Goths.<i>, aside</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.9</span>O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.10</span>Jove in a thatched house.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.11</span>When a man’s verses cannot be understood,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.12</span>nor a man’s good wit seconded with the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.13</span>forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.14</span>dead than a great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.15</span>would the gods had made thee poetical.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.16</span>I do not know what poetical is. Is it honest
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.17</span>in deed and word? Is it a true thing?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.18</span>No, truly, for the truest poetry is the most
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.19</span>feigning, and lovers are given to poetry, and what
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.20</span>they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.21</span>feign.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.22</span>Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.23</span>poetical?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.24</span>I do, truly, for thou swear’st to me thou
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.25</span>art honest. Now if thou wert a poet, I might have
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.26</span>some hope thou didst feign.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.27</span>Would you not have me honest?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.28</span>No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favored;
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.29</span>for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.30</span>sauce to sugar.<i>, aside</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.31</span>A material fool.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.32</span>Well, I am not fair, and therefore I pray the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.33</span>gods make me honest.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.34</span>Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.35</span>foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.36</span>dish.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.37</span>I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.38</span>foul.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.39</span>Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness;
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.40</span>sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.41</span>be, I will marry thee; and to that end I have been
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.42</span>with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next village,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.43</span>who hath promised to meet me in this place of the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.44</span>forest and to couple us.<i>, aside</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.45</span>I would fain see this meeting.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.46</span>Well, the gods give us joy.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.47</span>Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.48</span>heart, stagger in this attempt, for here we have no
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.49</span>temple but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.50</span>But what though? Courage. As horns are odious,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.51</span>they are necessary. It is said Many a man knows noend of his goods. Right: many a man has good
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.53</span>horns and knows no end of them. Well, that is the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.54</span>dowry of his wife; ’tis none of his own getting.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.55</span>Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no. The
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.56</span>noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.57</span>single man therefore blessed? No. As a walled town
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.58</span>is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.59</span>a married man more honorable than the bare brow
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.60</span>of a bachelor. And by how much defense is better
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.61</span>than no skill, by so much is a horn more precious
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.62</span>than to want.Enter Sir Oliver Martext.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.63</span>Here comes Sir Oliver.—Sir Oliver Martext, you are
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.64</span>well met. Will you dispatch us here under this tree,

<br>
<i>Enter Sir Oliver Martext.</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.66</span>Is there none here to give the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.67</span>woman?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.68</span>I will not take her on gift of any man.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.69</span>Truly, she must be given, or the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.70</span>marriage is not lawful.<i>, coming forward</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.71</span>Proceed, proceed. I’ll give
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.72</span>her.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.73</span>Good even, good Monsieur What-you-call-’t.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.74</span>How do you, sir? You are very well met. God
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.75</span>’ild you for your last company. I am very glad to see
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.76</span>you. Even a toy in hand here, sir. Nay, pray be
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.77</span>covered.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.78</span>Will you be married, motley?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.79</span>As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.80</span>curb, and the falcon her bells, so man hath his
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.81</span>desires; and as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.82</span>nibbling.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.83</span>And will you, being a man of your breeding, be
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.84</span>married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.85</span>church, and have a good priest that can tell you
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.86</span>what marriage is. This fellow will but join you
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.87</span>together as they join wainscot. Then one of you will
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.88</span>prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.89</span>warp.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.90</span>I am not in the mind but I were better to
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.91</span>be married of him than of another, for he is not like
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.92</span>to marry me well, and not being well married, it
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.93</span>will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.94</span>wife.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.95</span>Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.96</span>Come, sweet Audrey. We must be married,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.97</span>or we must live in bawdry.—Farewell, good
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.98</span>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.99</span>O sweet Oliver,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.100</span>O brave Oliver,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.101</span>Leave me not behind thee,Master Oliver, not
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.102</span>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.103</span>Wind away,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.104</span>Begone, I say,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.105</span>I will not to wedding with thee.But
<br>
<i>Audrey, Touchstone, and Jaques exit.</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.3.106</span>’Tis no matter. Ne’er a fantastical

Scene 4
</h2>
<br>
<i>Enter Rosalind, dressed as Ganymede, and Celia,dressed as Aliena.</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.1</span>Never talk to me. I will weep.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.2</span>Do, I prithee, but yet have the grace to consider
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.3</span>that tears do not become a man.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.4</span>But have I not cause to weep?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.5</span>As good cause as one would desire. Therefore
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.6</span>weep.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.7</span>His very hair is of the dissembling color.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.8</span>Something browner than Judas’s. Marry, his
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.9</span>kisses are Judas’s own children.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.10</span>I’ faith, his hair is of a good color.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.11</span>An excellent color. Your chestnut was ever the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.12</span>only color.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.13</span>And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.14</span>touch of holy bread.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.15</span>He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.16</span>nun of winter’s sisterhood kisses not more religiously.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.17</span>The very ice of chastity is in them.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.18</span>But why did he swear he would come this
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.19</span>morning, and comes not?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.20</span>Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.21</span>Do you think so?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.22</span>Yes, I think he is not a pickpurse nor a horse-stealer,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.23</span>but for his verity in love, I do think him as
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.24</span>concave as a covered goblet or a worm-eaten nut.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.25</span>Not true in love?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.26</span>Yes, when he is in, but I think he is not in.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.27</span>You have heard him swear downright he
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.28</span>was.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.29</span>Was is not is. Besides, the oath of a lover is
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.30</span>no stronger than the word of a tapster. They are
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.31</span>both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.32</span>here in the forest on the Duke your father.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.33</span>I met the Duke yesterday and had much
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.34</span>question with him. He asked me of what parentage
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.35</span>I was. I told him, of as good as he. So he laughed
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.36</span>and let me go. But what talk we of fathers when
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.37</span>there is such a man as Orlando?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.38</span>O, that’s a brave man. He writes brave verses,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.39</span>speaks brave words, swears brave oaths, and breaks
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.40</span>them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of

<span class="lineNum">3.4.41</span>his lover, as a puny tilter that spurs his horse but on

<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.45</span>Mistress and master, you have oft inquired

<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.47</span>Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,

<span class="lineNum">3.4.48</span>Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.49</span>That was his mistress.<i>, as Aliena</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.50</span>Well, and what of him?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.51</span>If you will see a pageant truly played
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.52</span>Between the pale complexion of true love
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.53</span>And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.54</span>Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.55</span>If you will mark it.<i>, aside to Celia</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.56</span>O come, let us remove.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.4.57</span>The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.

<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.1</span>Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me. Do not, Phoebe.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.2</span>Say that you love me not, but say not so
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.3</span>In bitterness. The common executioner,

<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.6</span>Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.7</span>But first begs pardon. Will you sterner be
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.8</span>Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
<br>
<i>Enter, unobserved, Rosalind as Ganymede, Celia asAliena, and Corin.</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.9</span>I would not be thy executioner.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.10</span>I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.11</span>Thou tell’st me there is murder in mine eye.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.12</span>’Tis pretty, sure, and very probable
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.13</span>That eyes, that are the frail’st and softest things,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.14</span>Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.15</span>Should be called tyrants, butchers, murderers.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.16</span>Now I do frown on thee with all my heart,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.17</span>And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.18</span>Now counterfeit to swoon;, why, now fall down;
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.19</span>Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.20</span>Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.21</span>Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.22</span>Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.23</span>Some scar of it. Lean upon a rush,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.24</span>The cicatrice and capable impressure
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.25</span>Thy palm some moment keeps. But now mine eyes,

<span class="lineNum">3.5.26</span>Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not;
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.27</span>Nor I am sure there is no force in eyes
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.28</span>That can do hurt.

<span class="lineNum">3.5.29</span>O dear Phoebe,

<span class="lineNum">3.5.30</span>If ever—as that ever may be near—
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.31</span>You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.32</span>Then shall you know the wounds invisible
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.33</span>That love’s keen arrows make.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.34</span>But till that time
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.35</span>Come not thou near me. And when that time
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.36</span>comes,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.37</span>Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.38</span>As till that time I shall not pity thee.<i>, as Ganymede, coming forward</i>

<span class="lineNum">3.5.39</span>And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.40</span>That you insult, exult, and all at once,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.41</span>Over the wretched? What though you have no
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.42</span>beauty—
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.43</span>As, by my faith, I see no more in you
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.44</span>Than without candle may go dark to bed—
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.45</span>Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.46</span>Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.47</span>I see no more in you than in the ordinary
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.48</span>Of nature’s sale-work.—’Od’s my little life,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.49</span>I think she means to tangle my eyes, too.—
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.50</span>No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.51</span>’Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.52</span>Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.53</span>That can entame my spirits to your worship.—
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.54</span>You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.55</span>Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.56</span>You are a thousand times a properer man
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.57</span>Than she a woman. ’Tis such fools as you
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.58</span>That makes the world full of ill-favored children.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.59</span>’Tis not her glass but you that flatters her,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.60</span>And out of you she sees herself more proper
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.61</span>Than any of her lineaments can show her.—
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.62</span>But, mistress, know yourself. Down on your knees
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.63</span>And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man’s love,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.64</span>For I must tell you friendly in your ear,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.65</span>Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.66</span>Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.67</span>Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.—
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.68</span>So take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.69</span>Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.70</span>I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.<i>,as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.71</span>He’s fall’n in love with your
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.72</span>foulness. (To Silvius.) And she’ll fall in love with
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.73</span>my anger. If it be so, as fast as she answers thee with
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.74</span>frowning looks, I’ll sauce her with bitter words. (ToPhoebe.) 
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.75</span>Why look you so upon me?
<br>
<i> (To Silvius.)</i>
<br>
<i> (ToPhoebe.) </i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.76</span>For no ill will I bear you.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.77</span>I pray you, do not fall in love with me,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.78</span>For I am falser than vows made in wine.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.79</span>Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.80</span>’Tis at the tuft of olives, here hard by.—
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.81</span>Will you go, sister?—Shepherd, ply her hard.—
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.82</span>Come, sister.—Shepherdess, look on him better,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.83</span>And be not proud. Though all the world could see,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.84</span>None could be so abused in sight as he.—
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.85</span>Come, to our flock.
<br>
<i>She exits, with Celia and Corin.</i><i>, aside</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.86</span>Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.87</span>Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.88</span>Sweet Phoebe—
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.89</span>Ha, what sayst thou, Silvius?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.90</span>Sweet Phoebe, pity me.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.91</span>Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.92</span>Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.93</span>If you do sorrow at my grief in love,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.94</span>By giving love your sorrow and my grief
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.95</span>Were both extermined.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.96</span>Thou hast my love. Is not that neighborly?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.97</span>I would have you.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.98</span>Why, that were covetousness.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.99</span>Silvius, the time was that I hated thee;
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.100</span>And yet it is not that I bear thee love;,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.101</span>But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.102</span>Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.103</span>I will endure, and I’ll employ thee too.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.104</span>But do not look for further recompense
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.105</span>Than thine own gladness that thou art employed.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.106</span>So holy and so perfect is my love,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.107</span>And I in such a poverty of grace,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.108</span>That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.109</span>To glean the broken ears after the man
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.110</span>That the main harvest reaps. Loose now and then
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.111</span>A scattered smile, and that I’ll live upon.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.112</span>Know’st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.113</span>Not very well, but I have met him oft,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.114</span>And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.115</span>That the old carlot once was master of.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.116</span>Think not I love him, though I ask for him.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.117</span>’Tis but a peevish boy—yet he talks well—
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.118</span>But what care I for words? Yet words do well
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.119</span>When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.120</span>It is a pretty youth—not very pretty—
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.121</span>But sure he’s proud—and yet his pride becomes
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.122</span>him.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.123</span>He’ll make a proper man. The best thing in him
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.124</span>Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.125</span>Did make offense, his eye did heal it up.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.126</span>He is not very tall—yet for his years he’s tall.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.127</span>His leg is but so-so—and yet ’tis well.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.128</span>There was a pretty redness in his lip,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.129</span>A little riper and more lusty red
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.130</span>Than that mixed in his cheek: ’twas just the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.131</span>difference
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.132</span>Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.133</span>There be some women, Silvius, had they marked
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.134</span>him
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.135</span>In parcels as I did, would have gone near
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.136</span>To fall in love with him; but for my part
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.137</span>I love him not nor hate him not; and yet
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.138</span>I have more cause to hate him than to love him.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.139</span>For what had he to do to chide at me?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.140</span>He said mine eyes were black and my hair black,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.141</span>And now I am remembered, scorned at me.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.142</span>I marvel why I answered not again.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.143</span>But that’s all one: omittance is no quittance.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.144</span>I’ll write to him a very taunting letter,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.145</span>And thou shalt bear it. Wilt thou, Silvius?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.146</span>Phoebe, with all my heart.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.147</span>I’ll write it straight.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.148</span>The matter’s in my head and in my heart.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.149</span>I will be bitter with him and passing short.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">3.5.150</span>Go with me, Silvius.

<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.1</span>I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.2</span>acquainted with thee.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.3</span>They say you are a melancholy

<span class="lineNum">4.1.4</span>fellow.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.5</span>I am so. I do love it better than laughing.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.6</span>Those that are in extremity

<span class="lineNum">4.1.7</span>of either are abominable fellows and betray

<span class="lineNum">4.1.8</span>themselves to every modern censure worse than
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.9</span>drunkards.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.10</span>Why, ’tis good to be sad and say nothing.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.11</span>Why then, ’tis good to be a
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.12</span>post.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.13</span>I have neither the scholar’s melancholy, which
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.14</span>is emulation; nor the musician’s, which is fantastical;
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.15</span>nor the courtier’s, which is proud; nor the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.16</span>soldier’s, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer’s,

<span class="lineNum">4.1.17</span>which is politic; nor the lady’s, which is nice; nor
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.18</span>the lover’s, which is all these; but it is a melancholy
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.19</span>of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.20</span>from many objects, and indeed the sundry
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.21</span>contemplation of my travels, in which my often
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.22</span>rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.23</span>A traveller. By my faith, you
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.24</span>have great reason to be sad. I fear you have sold
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.25</span>your own lands to see other men’s. Then to have
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.26</span>seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.27</span>and poor hands.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.28</span>Yes, I have gained my experience.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.29</span>And your experience makes
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.30</span>you sad. I had rather have a fool to make me merry
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.31</span>than experience to make me sad—and to travel for
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.32</span>it too.
<br>
<i>Enter Orlando.</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.33</span>Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind.

<span class="lineNum">4.1.38</span>the benefits of your own country, be out of love with
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.39</span>your nativity, and almost chide God for making you

<span class="lineNum">4.1.40</span>that countenance you are, or I will scarce think you
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.41</span>have swam in a gondola.Jaques exits.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.42</span>Why, how now, Orlando, where have you been all

<span class="lineNum">4.1.43</span>this while? You a lover? An you serve me such

<span class="lineNum">4.1.49</span>parts and break but a part of the thousand part of a
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.50</span>minute in the affairs of love, it may be said of him
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.51</span>that Cupid hath clapped him o’ th’ shoulder, but I’ll
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.52</span>warrant him heart-whole.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.53</span>Pardon me, dear Rosalind.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.54</span>Nay, an you be so tardy,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.55</span>come no more in my sight. I had as lief be wooed of

<span class="lineNum">4.1.56</span>a snail.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.57</span>Of a snail?<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.58</span>Ay, of a snail, for though he
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.59</span>comes slowly, he carries his house on his head—a
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.60</span>better jointure, I think, than you make a woman.

<span class="lineNum">4.1.61</span>Besides, he brings his destiny with him.

<span class="lineNum">4.1.63</span>Why, horns, which such as
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.64</span>you are fain to be beholding to your wives for. But
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.65</span>he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.66</span>slander of his wife.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.67</span>Virtue is no hornmaker, and my Rosalind is
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.68</span>virtuous.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.69</span>And I am your Rosalind.<i>, as Aliena</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.70</span>It pleases him to call you so, but he
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.71</span>hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you.<i>, as Ganymede, to Orlando</i>
<br>
<i>as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<i>to Orlando</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.72</span>Come, woo me,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.73</span>woo me, for now I am in a holiday humor, and like
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.74</span>enough to consent. What would you say to me now
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.75</span>an I were your very, very Rosalind?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.76</span>I would kiss before I spoke.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.77</span>Nay, you were better speak
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.78</span>first, and when you were gravelled for lack of
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.79</span>matter, you might take occasion to kiss. Very good
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.80</span>orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.81</span>lovers lacking—God warn us—matter, the cleanliest
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.82</span>shift is to kiss.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.83</span>How if the kiss be denied?<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.84</span>Then she puts you to entreaty,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.85</span>and there begins new matter.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.86</span>Who could be out, being before his beloved
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.87</span>mistress?<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.88</span>Marry, that should you if I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.89</span>were your mistress, or I should think my honesty
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.90</span>ranker than my wit.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.91</span>What, of my suit?<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.92</span>Not out of your apparel, and
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.93</span>yet out of your suit. Am not I your Rosalind?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.94</span>I take some joy to say you are because I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.95</span>would be talking of her.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.96</span>Well, in her person I say I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.97</span>will not have you.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.98</span>Then, in mine own person I die.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.99</span>No, faith, die by attorney.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.100</span>The poor world is almost six thousand years old,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.101</span>and in all this time there was not any man died in
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.102</span>his own person, videlicet, in a love cause. Troilus
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.103</span>had his brains dashed out with a Grecian club, yet
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.104</span>he did what he could to die before, and he is one of
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.105</span>the patterns of love. Leander, he would have lived
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.106</span>many a fair year though Hero had turned nun, if it
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.107</span>had not been for a hot midsummer night, for, good
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.108</span>youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.109</span>and, being taken with the cramp, was
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.110</span>drowned; and the foolish chroniclers of that age
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.111</span>found it was Hero of Sestos. But these are all lies.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.112</span>Men have died from time to time, and worms have
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.113</span>eaten them, but not for love.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.114</span>I would not have my right Rosalind of this
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.115</span>mind, for I protest her frown might kill me.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.116</span>By this hand, it will not kill a
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.117</span>fly. But come; now I will be your Rosalind in a more
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.118</span>coming-on disposition, and ask me what you will, I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.119</span>will grant it.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.120</span>Then love me, Rosalind.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.121</span>Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.122</span>Saturdays and all.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.123</span>And wilt thou have me?<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.124</span>Ay, and twenty such.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.125</span>What sayest thou?<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.126</span>Are you not good?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.127</span>I hope so.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.128</span>Why then, can one desire
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.129</span>too much of a good thing?—Come, sister, you shall
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.130</span>be the priest and marry us.—Give me your hand,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.131</span>Orlando.—What do you say, sister?<i>, to Celia</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.132</span>Pray thee marry us.<i>, as Aliena</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.133</span>I cannot say the words.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.134</span>You must begin Will you,Orlando—<i>, as Aliena</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.136</span>Go to.—Will you, Orlando, have to
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.137</span>wife this Rosalind?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.138</span>I will.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.139</span>Ay, but when?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.140</span>Why now, as fast as she can marry us.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.141</span>Then you must say I takethee, Rosalind, for wife.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.143</span>I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.144</span>I might ask you for your
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.145</span>commission, but I do take thee, Orlando, for my
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.146</span>husband. There’s a girl goes before the priest, and
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.147</span>certainly a woman’s thought runs before her
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.148</span>actions.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.149</span>So do all thoughts. They are winged.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.150</span>Now tell me how long you
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.151</span>would have her after you have possessed her?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.152</span>Forever and a day.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.153</span>Say a day without the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.154</span>ever. No, no, Orlando, men are April when they
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.155</span>woo, December when they wed. Maids are May
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.156</span>when they are maids, but the sky changes when
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.157</span>they are wives. I will be more jealous of thee than a
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.158</span>Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen, more clamorous
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.159</span>than a parrot against rain, more newfangled than
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.160</span>an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.161</span>will weep for nothing, like Diana in the fountain,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.162</span>and I will do that when you are disposed to be
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.163</span>merry. I will laugh like a hyena, and that when thou
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.164</span>art inclined to sleep.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.165</span>But will my Rosalind do so?<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.166</span>By my life, she will do as I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.167</span>do.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.168</span>O, but she is wise.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.169</span>Or else she could not have
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.170</span>the wit to do this. The wiser, the waywarder. Make
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.171</span>the doors upon a woman’s wit, and it will out at the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.172</span>casement. Shut that, and ’twill out at the keyhole.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.173</span>Stop that, ’twill fly with the smoke out at the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.174</span>chimney.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.175</span>A man that had a wife with such a wit, he
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.176</span>might say Wit, whither wilt?<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.177</span>Nay, you might keep that
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.178</span>check for it till you met your wife’s wit going to
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.179</span>your neighbor’s bed.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.180</span>And what wit could wit have to excuse that?<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.181</span>Marry, to say she came to
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.182</span>seek you there. You shall never take her without her
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.183</span>answer unless you take her without her tongue. O,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.184</span>that woman that cannot make her fault her husband’s
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.185</span>occasion, let her never nurse her child
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.186</span>herself, for she will breed it like a fool.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.187</span>For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.188</span>thee.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.189</span>Alas, dear love, I cannot lack
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.190</span>thee two hours.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.191</span>I must attend the Duke at dinner. By two
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.192</span>o’clock I will be with thee again.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.193</span>Ay, go your ways, go your
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.194</span>ways. I knew what you would prove. My friends told
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.195</span>me as much, and I thought no less. That flattering
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.196</span>tongue of yours won me. ’Tis but one cast away, and
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.197</span>so, come, death. Two o’clock is your hour?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.198</span>Ay, sweet Rosalind.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.199</span>By my troth, and in good
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.200</span>earnest, and so God mend me, and by all pretty
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.201</span>oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot of
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.202</span>your promise or come one minute behind your
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.203</span>hour, I will think you the most pathetical break-promise,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.204</span>and the most hollow lover, and the most
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.205</span>unworthy of her you call Rosalind that may be
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.206</span>chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.207</span>Therefore beware my censure, and keep your
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.208</span>promise.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.209</span>With no less religion than if thou wert indeed
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.210</span>my Rosalind. So, adieu.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.211</span>Well, time is the old justice
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.212</span>that examines all such offenders, and let time try.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.213</span>Adieu.

<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.214</span>You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.215</span>We must have your doublet and hose plucked
<br>

<span class="lineNum">4.1.218</span>O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.219</span>didst know how many fathom deep I am in love. But
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.220</span>it cannot be sounded; my affection hath an
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.221</span>unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.222</span>Or rather bottomless, that as fast as you pour
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.223</span>affection in, it runs out.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.224</span>No, that same wicked bastard of Venus, that
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.225</span>was begot of thought, conceived of spleen, and born
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.226</span>of madness, that blind rascally boy that abuses
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.227</span>everyone’s eyes because his own are out, let him be
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.228</span>judge how deep I am in love. I’ll tell thee, Aliena, I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.229</span>cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I’ll go find a
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.1.230</span>shadow and sigh till he come.

<span class="lineNum">4.3.8</span>My gentle Phoebe did bid me give you this.He gives Rosalind a paper.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.9</span>I know not the contents, but as I guess
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.10</span>By the stern brow and waspish action

<span class="lineNum">4.3.11</span>Which she did use as she was writing of it,

<br>
<i>Rosalind reads the letter.</i><i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.14</span>Patience herself would startle at this letter
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.15</span>And play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.16</span>She says I am not fair, that I lack manners.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.17</span>She calls me proud, and that she could not love me

<span class="lineNum">4.3.18</span>Were man as rare as phoenix. ’Od’s my will,

<span class="lineNum">4.3.19</span>Her love is not the hare that I do hunt.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.20</span>Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.21</span>This is a letter of your own device.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.22</span>No, I protest. I know not the contents.

<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.26</span>And turned into the extremity of love.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.27</span>I saw her hand. She has a leathern hand,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.28</span>A freestone-colored hand. I verily did think

<span class="lineNum">4.3.30</span>She has a huswife’s hand—but that’s no matter.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.31</span>I say she never did invent this letter.

<span class="lineNum">4.3.32</span>This is a man’s invention, and his hand.

<span class="lineNum">4.3.33</span>Sure it is hers.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.34</span>Why, ’tis a boisterous and a cruel style,

<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.79</span>Good morrow, fair ones. Pray you, if you know,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.80</span>Where in the purlieus of this forest stands

<span class="lineNum">4.3.81</span>A sheepcote fenced about with olive trees?<i>, as Aliena</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.82</span>West of this place, down in the neighbor bottom;

<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.85</span>But at this hour the house doth keep itself.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.86</span>There’s none within.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.87</span>If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.88</span>Then should I know you by description—
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.89</span>Such garments, and such years. The boy is fair,Of female favor, and bestows himselfLike a ripe sister; the woman lowAnd browner than her brother. Are not you
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.93</span>The owner of the house I did inquire for?<i>, as Aliena</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.94</span>It is no boast, being asked, to say we are.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.95</span>Orlando doth commend him to you both,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.96</span>And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.97</span>He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?
<br>
<i>He shows a stained handkerchief.</i><i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.98</span>I am. What must we understand by this?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.99</span>Some of my shame, if you will know of me
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.100</span>What man I am, and how, and why, and where
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.101</span>This handkercher was stained.<i>, as Aliena</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.102</span>I pray you tell it.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.103</span>When last the young Orlando parted from you,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.104</span>He left a promise to return again
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.105</span>Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.106</span>Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.107</span>Lo, what befell. He threw his eye aside—
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.108</span>And mark what object did present itself:
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.109</span>Under an old oak, whose boughs were mossed with
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.110</span>age
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.111</span>And high top bald with dry antiquity,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.112</span>A wretched, ragged man, o’ergrown with hair,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.113</span>Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.114</span>A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.115</span>Who with her head, nimble in threats, approached
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.116</span>The opening of his mouth. But suddenly,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.117</span>Seeing Orlando, it unlinked itself
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.118</span>And, with indented glides, did slip away
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.119</span>Into a bush, under which bush’s shade
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.120</span>A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.121</span>Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.122</span>When that the sleeping man should stir—for ’tis
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.123</span>The royal disposition of that beast
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.124</span>To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.125</span>This seen, Orlando did approach the man
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.126</span>And found it was his brother, his elder brother.<i>, as Aliena</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.127</span>O, I have heard him speak of that same brother,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.128</span>And he did render him the most unnatural
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.129</span>That lived amongst men.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.130</span>And well he might so do,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.131</span>For well I know he was unnatural.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.132</span>But to Orlando: did he leave him there,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.133</span>Food to the sucked and hungry lioness?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.134</span>Twice did he turn his back and purposed so,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.135</span>But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.136</span>And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.137</span>Made him give battle to the lioness,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.138</span>Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.139</span>From miserable slumber I awaked.<i>, as Aliena</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.140</span>Are you his brother?<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.141</span>Was ’t you he rescued?<i>, as Aliena</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.142</span>Was ’t you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.143</span>’Twas I, but ’tis not I. I do not shame
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.144</span>To tell you what I was, since my conversion
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.145</span>So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.146</span>But for the bloody napkin?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.147</span>By and by.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.148</span>When from the first to last betwixt us two
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.149</span>Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed—
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.150</span>As how I came into that desert place—
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.151</span>In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.152</span>Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.153</span>Committing me unto my brother’s love;
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.154</span>Who led me instantly unto his cave,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.155</span>There stripped himself, and here upon his arm
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.156</span>The lioness had torn some flesh away,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.157</span>Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.158</span>And cried in fainting upon Rosalind.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.159</span>Brief, I recovered him, bound up his wound,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.160</span>And after some small space, being strong at heart,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.161</span>He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.162</span>To tell this story, that you might excuse
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.163</span>His broken promise, and to give this napkin
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.164</span>Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.165</span>That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.
<br>
<i>Rosalind faints.</i><i>, as Aliena</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.166</span>Why, how now, Ganymede, sweet Ganymede?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.167</span>Many will swoon when they do look on blood.<i>, as Aliena</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.168</span>There is more in it.—Cousin Ganymede.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.169</span>Look, he recovers.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.170</span>I would I were at home.<i>, as Aliena</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.171</span>We’ll lead you thither.—I pray you,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.172</span>will you take him by the arm?<i>, helping Rosalind to rise</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.173</span>Be of good cheer,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.174</span>youth. You a man? You lack a man’s heart.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.175</span>I do so, I confess it. Ah,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.176</span>sirrah, a body would think this was well-counterfeited.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.177</span>I pray you tell your brother how well I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.178</span>counterfeited. Heigh-ho.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.179</span>This was not counterfeit. There is too great
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.180</span>testimony in your complexion that it was a passion
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.181</span>of earnest.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.182</span>Counterfeit, I assure you.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.183</span>Well then, take a good heart, and counterfeit to
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.184</span>be a man.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.185</span>So I do; but, i’ faith, I should
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.186</span>have been a woman by right.<i>, as Aliena</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.187</span>Come, you look paler and paler. Pray
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.188</span>you draw homewards.—Good sir, go with us.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.189</span>That will I, for I must bear answer back
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.190</span>How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.191</span>I shall devise something.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.192</span>But I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">4.3.193</span>Will you go?

<i>Enter William.</i>

<span class="lineNum">5.1.11</span>It is meat and drink to me to see a clown.

<span class="lineNum">5.1.12</span>By my troth, we that have good wits have much to

<span class="lineNum">5.1.17</span>Good ev’n, gentle friend. Cover thy head,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.18</span>cover thy head. Nay, prithee, be covered. How old
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.19</span>are you, friend?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.20</span>Five-and-twenty, sir.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.21</span>A ripe age. Is thy name William?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.22</span>William, sir.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.23</span>A fair name. Wast born i’ th’ forest here?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.24</span>Ay, sir, I thank God.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.25</span>Thank God. A good answer. Art rich?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.26</span>’Faith sir, so-so.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.27</span>So-so is good, very good, very excellent
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.28</span>good. And yet it is not: it is but so-so. Art thou wise?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.29</span>Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.30</span>Why, thou sayst well. I do now remember
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.31</span>a saying: The fool doth think he is wise, but thewise man knows himself to be a fool. The heathen
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.33</span>philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.34</span>would open his lips when he put it into his mouth,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.35</span>meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.36</span>lips to open. You do love this maid?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.37</span>I do, sir.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.38</span>Give me your hand. Art thou learned?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.39</span>No, sir.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.40</span>Then learn this of me: to have is to have.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.41</span>For it is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.42</span>out of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.43</span>empty the other. For all your writers do consent
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.44</span>that ipse is he. Now, you are not ipse, for I am he.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.45</span>Which he, sir?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.46</span>He, sir, that must marry this woman.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.47</span>Therefore, you clown, abandon—which is in the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.48</span>vulgar leave—the society—which in the boorish
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.49</span>is company—of this female—which in the common
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.50</span>is woman; which together is, abandon the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.51</span>society of this female, or, clown, thou perishest; or,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.52</span>to thy better understanding, diest; or, to wit, I kill
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.53</span>thee, make thee away, translate thy life into death,

<span class="lineNum">5.1.54</span>thy liberty into bondage. I will deal in poison with

<span class="lineNum">5.1.56</span>thee in faction. I will o’errun thee with policy. I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.57</span>will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways. Therefore
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.58</span>tremble and depart.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.1.59</span>Do, good William.<i>, to Touchstone</i>

<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.30</span>O, I know where you are.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.31</span>Nay, ’tis true. There was never anything so sudden
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.32</span>but the fight of two rams, and Caesar’s thrasonical
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.33</span>brag of I came, saw, and overcame. For your
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.34</span>brother and my sister no sooner met but they
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.35</span>looked, no sooner looked but they loved, no sooner
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.36</span>loved but they sighed, no sooner sighed but they
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.37</span>asked one another the reason, no sooner knew the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.38</span>reason but they sought the remedy; and in these
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.39</span>degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.40</span>which they will climb incontinent, or else be incontinent
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.41</span>before marriage. They are in the very wrath
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.42</span>of love, and they will together. Clubs cannot part
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.43</span>them.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.44</span>They shall be married tomorrow, and I will
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.45</span>bid the Duke to the nuptial. But O, how bitter a
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.46</span>thing it is to look into happiness through another
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.47</span>man’s eyes. By so much the more shall I tomorrow
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.48</span>be at the height of heart-heaviness by how much I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.49</span>shall think my brother happy in having what he
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.50</span>wishes for.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.51</span>Why, then, tomorrow I cannot
<br>

<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.53</span>I can live no longer by thinking.<i>, as Ganymede</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.54</span>I will weary you then no
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.55</span>longer with idle talking. Know of me then—for
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.56</span>now I speak to some purpose—that I know you are
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.57</span>a gentleman of good conceit. I speak not this that
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.58</span>you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.59</span>insomuch I say I know you are. Neither do I labor
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.60</span>for a greater esteem than may in some little measure
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.61</span>draw a belief from you to do yourself good, and
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.62</span>not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.63</span>can do strange things. I have, since I was three year
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.64</span>old, conversed with a magician, most profound in
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.65</span>his art and yet not damnable. If you do love Rosalind
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.66</span>so near the heart as your gesture cries it out,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.67</span>when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.68</span>her. I know into what straits of fortune she is
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.69</span>driven, and it is not impossible to me, if it appear
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.70</span>not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.71</span>tomorrow, human as she is, and without any

<br>

<span class="lineNum">5.2.83</span>I care not if I have. It is my study

<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.2.87</span>Good shepherd, tell this youth what ’tis to love.

<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.41</span>Good my lord, bid him welcome.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.42</span>This is the motley-minded gentleman that I have so
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.43</span>often met in the forest. He hath been a courtier, he
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.44</span>swears.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.45</span>If any man doubt that, let him put me to
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.46</span>my purgation. I have trod a measure. I have flattered
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.47</span>a lady. I have been politic with my friend,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.48</span>smooth with mine enemy. I have undone three
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.49</span>tailors. I have had four quarrels, and like to have
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.50</span>fought one.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.51</span>And how was that ta’en up?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.52</span>Faith, we met and found the quarrel was
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.53</span>upon the seventh cause.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.54</span>How seventh cause?—Good my lord, like
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.55</span>this fellow.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.56</span>I like him very well.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.57</span>God ’ild you, sir. I desire you of the like. I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.58</span>press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.59</span>copulatives, to swear and to forswear, according as
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.60</span>marriage binds and blood breaks. A poor virgin, sir,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.61</span>an ill-favored thing, sir, but mine own. A poor
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.62</span>humor of mine, sir, to take that that no man else
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.63</span>will. Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.64</span>house, as your pearl in your foul oyster.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.65</span>By my faith, he is very swift and
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.66</span>sententious.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.67</span>According to the fool’s bolt, sir, and such
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.68</span>dulcet diseases.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.69</span>But for the seventh cause. How did you find the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.70</span>quarrel on the seventh cause?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.71</span>Upon a lie seven times removed.—Bear
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.72</span>your body more seeming, Audrey.—As thus, sir: I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.73</span>did dislike the cut of a certain courtier’s beard. He
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.74</span>sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well, he
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.75</span>was in the mind it was. This is called the retortcourteous. If I sent him word again it was not well
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.77</span>cut, he would send me word he cut it to please
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.78</span>himself. This is called the quip modest. If again it
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.79</span>was not well cut, he disabled my judgment. This is
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.80</span>called the reply churlish. If again it was not well
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.81</span>cut, he would answer I spake not true. This is called
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.82</span>the reproof valiant. If again it was not well cut, he
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.83</span>would say I lie. This is called the countercheckquarrelsome, and so to the lie circumstantial,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.85</span>and the lie direct.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.86</span>And how oft did you say his beard was not well
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.87</span>cut?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.88</span>I durst go no further than the lie circumstantial,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.89</span>nor he durst not give me the lie direct, and
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.90</span>so we measured swords and parted.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.91</span>Can you nominate in order now the degrees of
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.92</span>the lie?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.93</span>O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book, as
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.94</span>you have books for good manners. I will name you
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.95</span>the degrees: the first, the retort courteous; the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.96</span>second, the quip modest; the third, the replychurlish; the fourth, the reproof valiant; the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.98</span>fifth, the countercheck quarrelsome; the sixth,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.99</span>the lie with circumstance; the seventh, the liedirect. All these you may avoid but the lie direct,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.101</span>and you may avoid that too with an if. I knew
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.102</span>when seven justices could not take up a quarrel, but
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.103</span>when the parties were met themselves, one of them
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.104</span>thought but of an if, as: If you said so, then I saidso. And they shook hands and swore brothers.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.106</span>Your if is the only peacemaker: much virtue in
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.107</span>if.<i>, to Duke</i>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.108</span>Is not this a rare fellow, my lord?
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.109</span>He’s as good at anything and yet a fool.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.110</span>He uses his folly like a stalking-horse,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.111</span>and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit.

<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.156</span>Let me have audience for a word or two.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.157</span>I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.158</span>That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.159</span>Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.160</span>Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.161</span>Addressed a mighty power, which were on foot
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.162</span>In his own conduct, purposely to take
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.163</span>His brother here and put him to the sword;
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.164</span>And to the skirts of this wild wood he came,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.165</span>Where, meeting with an old religious man,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.166</span>After some question with him, was converted
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.167</span>Both from his enterprise and from the world,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.168</span>His crown bequeathing to his banished brother,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.169</span>And all their lands restored to them again
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.170</span>That were with him exiled. This to be true
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.171</span>I do engage my life.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.172</span>Welcome, young man.
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.173</span>Thou offer’st fairly to thy brothers’ wedding:

<span class="lineNum">5.4.174</span>To one his lands withheld, and to the other

<span class="lineNum">5.4.175</span>A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.—
<br>
<span class="lineNum">5.4.176</span>First, in this forest let us do those ends

<span class="lineNum">5.4.177</span>That here were well begun and well begot,

<span class="lineNum">5.4.187</span>The Duke hath put on a religious life

<span class="lineNum">5.4.188</span>And thrown into neglect the pompous court.

<span class="lineNum">5.4.189</span>He hath.

<span class="lineNum">5.4.200</span>loving voyage

<span class="lineNum">5.4.201</span>Is but for two months victualled.—So to your

Scene EPI
</h2>
<br>
<span class="lineNum">EPI.1</span>It is not the fashion to see the lady the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">EPI.2</span>epilogue, but it is no more unhandsome than to see
<br>
<span class="lineNum">EPI.3</span>the lord the prologue. If it be true that good wine
<br>
<span class="lineNum">EPI.4</span>needs no bush, ’tis true that a good play needs no
<br>
<span class="lineNum">EPI.5</span>epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes,
<br>
<span class="lineNum">EPI.6</span>and good plays prove the better by the help of good
<br>
<span class="lineNum">EPI.7</span>epilogues. What a case am I in then that am neither
<br>
<span class="lineNum">EPI.8</span>a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with you in
<br>
<span class="lineNum">EPI.9</span>the behalf of a good play! I am not furnished like a
<br>
<span class="lineNum">EPI.10</span>beggar; therefore to beg will not become me. My
<br>
<span class="lineNum">EPI.11</span>way is to conjure you, and I’ll begin with the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">EPI.12</span>women. I charge you, O women, for the love you
<br>
<span class="lineNum">EPI.13</span>bear to men, to like as much of this play as please
<br>
<span class="lineNum">EPI.14</span>you. And I charge you, O men, for the love you bear
<br>
<span class="lineNum">EPI.15</span>to women—as I perceive by your simpering, none
<br>
<span class="lineNum">EPI.16</span>of you hates them—that between you and the
<br>
<span class="lineNum">EPI.17</span>women the play may please. If I were a woman, I
<br>
<span class="lineNum">EPI.18</span>would kiss as many of you as had beards that
<br>
<span class="lineNum">EPI.19</span>pleased me, complexions that liked me, and breaths
<br>
<span class="lineNum">EPI.20</span>that I defied not. And I am sure as many as have
<br>
<span class="lineNum">EPI.21</span>good beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths will for
<br>
<span class="lineNum">EPI.22</span>my kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.
